/** @file deltadb.h

deltadb is a persistent database for keeping track of a set of
json objects, each indexed by a unique key and described by a set of
arbitrary name value pairs.  The current state of the database
is kept in memory for fast queries, while a history of all modifications
is logged to disk to enable recovering the state of the database
at any point in the past.

The history function is secondary to the online access function,
so as a general rule, errors in accessing the on-disk history
are ignored in order to keep the online access going.

The on-disk history works as follows:

For each day of the year, a checkpoint file is created which is an exact
snapshot of the table at the beginning of the day.  For updates received
during that day, a corresponding log file records the individual changes.

The state of the table at any time can be obtained by starting with
the proper daily checkpoint, then playing the log of updates until
the desired time is reached.  This could be used to creating arbitrary
snapshots in time, or for running more complex queries that show the
change of a single entity over time.

The log directory is broken down by year and day-of-year, so that
each checkpoint file is named DIR/YEAR/DAY.ckpt and the corresponding
log file is named DIR/YEAR/DAY.log

The checkpoint file is simply a json object containing
the keys and values of all the objects in the database.

The log file consists of a series of entries,
each one a json array in the following formats:

<pre>
T [time]               - Indicates the current time in Unix epoch format.
t [secs]               - Indicates passage of time since last T or t. 
C [key] [object]       - Create a new object with the given key.
D [key] [object]       - Delete an object with the given key.
U [key] [name] [value] - Update a named property with a new value.
R [key] [name]         - Remove a property with the given name.

In the examples above, time is a JSON integer,
key and name are JSON strings, object is a JSON object,
and value can be any JSON value.
</pre>

As of 2012, with approx 300 entities reporting to the catalog,
each day results in 20MB of log data and 150KB of checkpoint data,
totalling under 8GB data per year.
