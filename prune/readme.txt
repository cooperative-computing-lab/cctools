PRUNE: A technique for large scale workflow preservation and management

This program is designed to enable users to preserve large scale workflow executions and revisions. The user has complete control over the granularity at which each step of the workflow is defined.





The following basic commands are fundamental to PRUNE:

**PUT [local.txt] [prune_name]: Files to be used in the workflow can be added to the preserved namespace.
  Ex. PUT mylocalfilename.txt AS data_name_in_prune

**GET [prune_name] [local.txt]: Files generated by the workflow can be put into the user's namespace for use by some external program.
  Ex. GET data_name_in_prune AS mylocalfilename.txt

**WORK [FOR <timeout>]: Blocking function that instructs PRUNE to start executing the workflow with whatever resources are available.
  Ex. WORK FOR 60    #Block for 60 seconds so PRUNE can work

**USE <resource> [<arguments>]: Define resources that are available to prune
  Ex. USE wq prune      #Start and use a Work Queue master with the name 'prune'

**EVAL <name(s)> = <expression> (default): Evaluate an expression and assign the results to the specified name(s). Work defined in these statements will not be executed until control is passes to PRUNE such as with the GO command.
  Ex. sorted_data = sort(input_data)

Functions are currently defined within a script file (which is PUT in the system) to define the types of arguments the script expects and the output files that should be preserved.
  Ex.  #PRUNE_INPUTS File File Text
  Ex.  #PRUNE_OUTPUT outfile1.txt
  Ex.  #PRUNE_OUTPUT outfile2.txt




The following commands are also available for convenience:

*STATUS [FOR <timeout>]: How many items are at each stage of execution, Run, Running, Complete.
*LOCATE <name>: Show where the file is cached in PRUNE (if available)
*RUN <name>: Treat each line in a file as if it were typed into the PRUNE interface.
*RESET: Truncate the database and delete and data files and sandboxes.



An ENV command will come soon will will provide an Umbrella specification of the envrionment operations should be performed in to ensure libraries and configuration data are available on any computational resource.




When PRUNE is started using the "prune" executable, an interface becomes available for the user to type commands. Ctrl-C will terminate PRUNE and upon restarting any previously running tasks revert to the "Run" status.

The user will be initially prompted to specify locations for a database file, data folder, and sandbox folder. This meta-data will be stored in the working directory as a file named .prune.conf for PRUNE to use later. The ability to specify a specific conf file in a directory other than the working directory will be added later on.



Here is a full example of a merge sort:

$ prune
PRUNE$ PUT sort.sh AS sort
PRUNE$ PUT merge.sh AS merge
PRUNE$ PUT nouns.txt AS nouns
PRUNE$ PUT verbs.txt AS verbs
PRUNE$ a = sort(nouns)                  
PRUNE$ b = sort(verbs)                  
PRUNE$ merged_result = merge(a,b)
PRUNE$ USE wq prune
Work Queue master started on port 9001 with name 'prune'...
warning: this work queue master is visible to the public.
warning: you should set a password with the --password option.
PRUNE$ GET merged_result AS test.txt           
PRUNE$

File --- sort.sh ---
#!/bin/bash
#PRUNE_INPUTS File
#PRUNE_OUTPUT sorted_data.txt
sort $1 > sorted_data.txt

File --- merge.sh ---
#!/bin/bash
#PRUNE_INPUTS File*
#PRUNE_OUTPUT merged_output.txt
sort -m $@ > merged_output.txt
