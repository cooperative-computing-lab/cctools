# meta.makeflow: Simple makeflow that operates on another makeflow to render it
# correct. Also tests that the command translation prepends "./" to the correct
# token, even with early input or output tokens.
#
# Expected test case results: Success.
# Expected test case results: Failure: "capital.360.jpg" does not exist and is not defined by a rule.
