Hacking
=======

Rough guidelines for hacking on Weaver.

General
~~~~~~~

- When possible, follow PEP8.
	* Classes, global objects, and class attributes are CamelCase.
	* Methods, attributes, and functions should use underscores.
	* Constants are in upper-case.

- Check Python source with pylint.

- Use the following vim style::

  vim: set sts=4 sw=4 ts=8 expandtab ft=python:

Classes
~~~~~~~

- Prefix internal attributes and methods with '_'.  By internal we mean
  attributes and methods that end users should not use directly, but project
  modules may take advantage of.  This also applies to internal global objects.

Imports
~~~~~~~

- For internal modules, utilize ``from weaver.<module> import <object>``.

- For standard and third-party modules, utilize ``import``.
