Weaver - README
===============

Overview
--------

Weaver is a high-level framework that enables the integration of distributed
computing abstractions into scientific and data processing workflows using the
Python programming language.  Weaver is currently under major development and
thus it should be considered unstable.

Dependencies
------------

Required:
	- Python <http://www.python.org> (2.6.x, 2.7.x, 3.x)

Although other versions of Python may work, Weaver has only been tested with
Python 2.6.x, Python 2.7.x and 3.2.x.  In order to execute the DAGs produced by
Weaver, makeflow is required.

Optional:
	- mysql-python <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/>

	  If you want to use MySQL-based datasets, then you must install the
	  database connector.

Usage
-----

To generate a DAG sandbox, compile your workflow using `weaver` as so::

	$ weaver -o map_example examples/map.py

You can then examine the sandbox and run the appropriate DAG execution engine
on the generated DAG.  By default, Weaver generates makeflow DAGs and which
can be used as follows::

	$ weaver -o map_example examples/map.py
	$ cd map_example
	$ makeflow Makeflow

For more information about the compiler run::

	$ weaver -h
