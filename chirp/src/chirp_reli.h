/** @file chirp_reli.h The primary user API for accessing Chirp servers.

@ref chirp_reli.h is designed to look similar to the Unix I/O interface.
It is called "reli" because it is "reliable".
Each function call here has the capabaility to detect and retry a large number
of network and server errors with an exponential backoff, until a user-defined time limit is reached.
The caller need not worry about connecting to or disconnecting from servers.

All functions in this file have several common calling conventions.
@param host A hostname may be a domain name or an IP address, followed by an optional colon and port number.
If not given, the port number is assumed to by the default Chirp port of 9094.
@param path A pathname identifies a file from the root of the given file server, and must start with a slash.
The Chirp protocol allows pathnames to contain any printable ASCII character except a newline.
@param stoptime All functions accept a final argument <tt>time_t stoptime</tt> which
indicates the absolute time at which to abort.  For example, to
try an operation for 60 seconds, pass <tt>time(0)+60</tt> as <tt>stoptime</tt>.
Any transient network failures will be silently retried until this timeout is reached.
@return On success, all functions return an integer <b>greater than or equal to zero</b>,
and <tt>errno</tt> may have any arbitrary value.
On failure, all return an integer <b>less than zero</b>, and set errno
to the reason for the failure.  (@ref chirp_reli_open is the only exception to this rule.)
The caller may invoke <tt>strerror(errno)</tt> to generate a human-readable string representing the error.

/** Creates or opens a file in preparation for I/O.
@param host The name and port of the Chirp server to access.
@param path The pathname of the file to access.
@param flags Any of the following Unix open flags ORed together:
- O_RDONLY - Open for reading only.
- O_WRONLY - Open for writing only.
- O_RDWR - Open for both read and write.
- O_APPEND - Open for appending to the file.
- O_CREAT - Create the file if it does not exist.
- O_TRUNC - Truncate the file to zero bytes.
- O_SYNC - Force synchronous writes to disk.
@param mode The Unix mode bits to be given to the file.  Chirp only honors the owner component of the mode bits.  Typical choices
are <tt>0700</tt> for an executable, and <tt>0600</tt> for a data file.  (Note the leading zero to indicate octal data.)
@param stoptime The absolute time at which to abort.
@return On success, returns a pointer to a chirp_file.  On failure, returns zero and sets errno appropriately.
