/** @file ds_manager.h A manager-worker library.
 This provides an implementation of the manager-worker computing model
 using TCP sockets, Unix applications, and files as intermediate buffers.  A
 manager process uses @ref ds_create to create a queue, then @ref
 ds_submit to submit tasks.  Once tasks are running, call @ref
 ds_wait to wait for completion. A generic worker program, named
 <tt>ds_worker</tt>, can be run on any machine, and simply needs to be
 told the host and port of the manager.

@param q A ds_manager object
@param name The name of the parameter to tune
 - "resource-submit-multiplier" Treat each worker as having ({cores,memory,gpus} * multiplier) when submitting tasks. This allows for tasks to wait at a worker rather than the manager. (default = 1.0)
 - "min-transfer-timeout" Set the minimum number of seconds to wait for files to be transferred to or from a worker. (default=10)
 - "transfer-outlier-factor" Transfer that are this many times slower than the average will be aborted.  (default=10x)
 - "default-transfer-rate" The assumed network bandwidth used until sufficient data has been collected.  (1MB/s)
 - "fast-abort-multiplier" Set the multiplier of the average task time at which point to abort; if negative or zero fast_abort is deactivated. (default=0)
 - "keepalive-interval" Set the minimum number of seconds to wait before sending new keepalive checks to workers. (default=300)
 - "keepalive-timeout" Set the minimum number of seconds to wait for a keepalive response from worker before marking it as dead. (default=30)
 - "short-timeout" Set the minimum timeout when sending a brief message to a single worker. (default=5s)
 - "category-steady-n-tasks" Set the number of tasks considered when computing category buckets.
 - "hungry-minimum" Mimimum number of tasks to consider manager not hungry. (default=10)
 - "wait-for-workers" Mimimum number of workers to connect before starting dispatching tasks. (default=0)
 - "wait_retrieve_many" Parameter to alter how ds_wait works. If set to 0, ds_wait breaks out of the while loop whenever a task changes to DS_TASK_DONE (wait_retrieve_one mode). If set to 1, ds_wait does not break, but continues recieving and dispatching tasks. This occurs until no task is sent or recieved, at which case it breaks out of the while loop (wait_retrieve_many mode). (default=0)
@param value The value to set the parameter to.
@return 0 on succes, -1 on failure.
