/** @file ds_json.h A manager-worker library.
 The work queue provides an implementation of the manager-worker computing model
 using TCP sockets, Unix applications, and files as intermediate buffers.  A
 manager process uses @ref ds_json_create to create a queue, then @ref
 ds_json_submit to submit tasks. Once tasks are running, call @ref
 ds_json_wait to wait for completion.
