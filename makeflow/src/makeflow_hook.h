/* ----------------------------------------------------------- *
 * Basic MAKEFLOW HOOK API					       *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------- */

/**
 * Configuration example of the high-level API
 *
 * The first step is to write the function definitions that will
 * be specified in the hook struct.
 *
 * E.G.
 * int makeflow_hook_example_create(struct jx *jx){
 *		printf("Hello from module: EXAMPLE.\n");
 *		return MAKEFLOW_HOOK_SUCCESS;
 * }
 *
 * NOTE: Unless specified in the documentation, a return of 
 * MAKEFLOW_HOOK_SUCCESS indicates success, and other return
 * codes indicate varies failures. NO FURTHER ACTION IS TAKEN 
 * ON FAILURE, unless specified. Makeflow/workflow will abort.
 * Return MAKEFLOW_HOOK_SUCCESS unless fatal error.
 * 
 * The second step for utilizing this HOOK API is to create a
 * uniquely named struct for your HOOK. This struct will be used
 * to equate (using function pointers) a function definition with
 * the events in Makeflow's event loop. This struct should be 
 * located at the bottom of your module definition, and visible
 * from other compilation units, i.e. not static.
 *
 * E.G.
 * struct makeflow_hook makeflow_hook_example = {
 *    .module_name = "EXAMPLE",
 *    .create = makeflow_hook_example_create,
 *    .destroy = makeflow_hook_example_destroy,
 * }
 *
 * NOTE: It is important to only specify event hooks that are
 * defined. This will allow for flexible addition of hooks in
 * the future without breaking existing functionality. 
 * -- C99 Feature
 *
 * The third step is to add and register your hook in Makeflow.
 *
 * E.G.
 * extern struct makeflow_hook makeflow_hook_example;
 * makeflow_hook_register_hook(&makeflow_hook_example);
 *
 * Finally, the file where your hook definition resides needs
 * to be added to the makeflow/src/Makefile so that it is built.
 *

/**
 * The makeflow hook operations:
 *
 * Each hook operations corresponds to a transition in the
 * state of a structure in Makeflow. The three main structures
 * that hold state in Makeflow are the DAG, nodes, and files.
 * 
 * DAG: UNINIT -> PARSE -> START -> [END, FAILED, ABORTED]
 * NODE: -> CREATED -> WAITING -> RUNNING -> [COMPLETE, FAILED, ABORTED]
 * FILE: CREATE -> EXPECT -> EXIST -> COMPLETE -> CLEAN -> DELETED
 *             
 *
 * All methods are optional. 
 *
 * Here are list the immutable features and structures for each
 * high level struct:
 * DAG: parse, check, start, loop, end, fail, abort
 * Node: create, check, submit, end, fail, success
 * File: complete, clean, delete
