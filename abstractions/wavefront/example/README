This is an example problem to use with the Wavefront abstraction.
The abstraction computes the contents of a large matrix M such that:

M[i,j] = F(M[i-1,j],M[i,j-1],M[i-1,j-1])

To run Wavefront, you need to set up an input file with the
initial boundary values of M, and provide a function that computes
a new cell from the adjacent cells.  The abstraction will produce
an output file with all of the values of the matrix.

This directory contains a toy problem provided by Dr. Kenneth Judd
at Stanford University.  It represents a common category of problems
found in economics.  The function computes the Nash equilibrium between
two players in a game.  

Compile the example function like this:

% gcc example.func.c -o example.func -lm

To run a sample problem, start the Wavefront master process,
specify the size of the problem, the function, the input data,
and where to place the output data:

% wavefront_master 10 10 example.func example.input.data example.output.data

Then, start one or more worker processes, and tell them to contact
the master process using host name and port number:

% worker mymachine.somewhere.edu 9068

The master process will then output a series of lines detailing the
progress of the entire computation.  If the master fails or is killed,
it can simply be restarted with the same command.  It will read in the
already completed work, and continue where it left off.

Enough input is provided for a problem of up to 500x500.

Each function call takes about 5 seconds to execute on a modern
desktop processor.  Sequentially the problem is O(n^2).  By adding
workers, you can parallelize the work into O(n) time.
