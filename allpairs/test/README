TR_allpairs_composite.sh

Computes the list of composite numbers by brute force. We form the
pairs of all numbers from 2 to 50, and check if the first one is
properly divisible by the second one.

TR_allpairs_bitwise.sh

Compare the source of allpairs with the hard coded BITWISE function.
This test could be better, since we only count the number of lines
generated.
