This directory contains examples of tools and scripts contributed from the
CCTools user community. The examples are included to demonstrate particular
solutions that are particular to certain computing environments, and might not
work in general settings.  While we are happy to share user contributions, the
CCL team is not able to provide support for the software in this directory.
