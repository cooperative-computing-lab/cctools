Instructions:

1) Update meta.yaml to desire cctools version number (so that the URL to download from is up to date)

2) Install conda-build and anaconda-client if you don't have it already

3) Run "conda-build ." in the recipe directory to build locally

4) Upload to the cclnd account on anaconda using the location given: "anaconda upload --user cclnd /PATH/TO/PACKAGE/"

5) Repeat for each version of python and OS you want to support (using miniconda2/3 as appropriate)
