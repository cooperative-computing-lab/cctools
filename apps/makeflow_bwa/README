The makeflow_bwa program aligns genome sequences listed in a fastq file to the given 
a fasta reference. It uses the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. It aligns by partitioning the file into 
pieces containing one or more sequences and distributing them for individual alignment. The 
program uses the Makeflow and Work Queue frameworks for distributed execution on available 
resources. 

To build Makeflow: 

1. Install BWA and all its required dependencies. BWA can be downloaded from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/files/
2. Install CCTools. 
3. Copy makeflow_bwa from cctools/apps to the location the makeflow will be executed.
4. Run './makeflow_bwa --ref test_ref.fa --fastq test_pe_1.fq --output_SAM output.sam --algoalign backtrack --makeflow Makeflow' 
This produces a file called Makeflow.

To run:

1. Run 'makeflow'
Note if the --makeflow option is specified with a MAKEFLOWFILE, run
makeflow <MAKEFLOWFILE> 

This step runs the makeflow locally on the machine on which it is executed.

2. If you want to run with a distributed execution engine (Work Queue, Condor,
or SGE), specify the '-T' option. For example, to run with Work Queue, 
makeflow -T wq

3. Start Workers
work_queue_workers -d all <HOSTNAME> <PORT> 
where <HOSTNAME> is the name of the host on which the master is running
      <PORT> is the port number on which the master is listening.

Alternatively, you can also specify a project name for the master and use that
to start workers:
1. makeflow -T wq -N BWA
2. work_queue_worker -d all -N BWA 

For listing the command-line options, do:
./makeflow_bwa -h 

When the alignment completes, you will find the whole output from the individual partitions 
in the directory the makeflow was run in.
