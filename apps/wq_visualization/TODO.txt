Animation Things
	Loop gif
	Frame Rate - Can it go any faster

File Things
	- Correlate file size to size of the box
	- Bubble the Legend based on popularity. Leftmost files on machine should be topmost files in Legend

Color List
	- When people/workflow are dumb and don't use caching options, we run out of file colors and use black
		- Try to create a dynamic color list that creates the most
		  distinct color from all previous colors it has already created

Viz Scaling Things
	- Too many workers, such a small GIF - find a way to reconcile this
	- Real Time frames
		- keep the timestamp from each line, and when the timestamp changes, then save the frame
		- while timestamp has not changed, keep a list of connections and machines to highlight
		- be careful to do this after the read file loop also, in case the last line is not a useful line

	- Make workers' size correlate to the resources
		- Number of file rows correlates to total disk on machine

	- Correlate connection size with bandwidth

Performance Things -
	- Execution is bound by appending GIFs to one another, and this slows
	  down the more frames there are. Will be helped by Viz Scaling Things->Real Time Frames
