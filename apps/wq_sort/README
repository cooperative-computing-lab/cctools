The wq_sort program sorts a column of integers in a file by partitioning the
file into pieces and distributing them for individual sorting. The program uses
the Work Queue framework for distributed execution on available resources.

To run:

1. Run 'make'.
2. Run './wq_sort /bin/sort sample.txt' that uses the GNU sort utility as the
computation kernel and sorts the integers in the file sample.txt.
3. Start workers:
work_queue_workers -d all <HOSTNAME> <PORT>
where <HOSTNAME> is the name of the host on which the manager is running
	  <PORT> is the port number on which the manager is listening.

Alternatively, you can also specify a project name for the manager and use that
to start workers:

1. ./wq_sort -N WQSORT /bin/sort sample.txt
2. work_queue_worker -d all -N WQSORT

For listing the command-line options, do:
./wq_sort -h

When the sorting completes, you will find the output file in the same directory
as where wq_sort was run.
