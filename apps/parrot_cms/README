Thanks for Dan Bradley <dan@hep.wisc.edu> for providing this example.

This is an example of running a CMS simulation job using
the CVMFS filesystem accessed via Parrot.  It is typical of
how CMS jobs are run on the Open Science Grid.   All of the
bootstrap data is present here -- everything is is downloaded
on demand using the CVMFS filesystem.

In order to run the example correctly, you must have cctools
build against the CVMFS filesystem, and also access to an
HTTP proxy that is part of the CVMFS caching hierarchy.
The code is meant to run on Scientific Linux 5 but appears
to run correctly on RHEL5/6 as long as SCRAM_ARCH is set correctly.

As written, the example relies upon a specific proxy
(cache01.hep.wisc.edu) which is known to be accessible
on the wisc.edu and nd.edu networks.  If you run it elsewhere,
you will almost certainly have to change the HTTP_PROXY
setting to point to your own proxy server.

The SITECONF directory is a mandatory configuration directory
found at all CMS data analysis sites under a fixed path.
When the job runs elsewhere, we must provide our own SITECONF
directory and mount it into the appropriate place using the
-M option to Parrot.

To run the example:

./parrot.cmsjob.sh

The example completes in about 5 minutes with a cold CVMFS cache,
and about 1 minute with a warm cache.

The correct output is:

GEN,SIM,ENDJOB
We have determined that this is simulation (if not, rerun cmsDriver.py
with --data)
