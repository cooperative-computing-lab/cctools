To make a gif visualization of a work_queue process given just cctools and the required dependencies (see README), do the following:

1.) Run a work_queue process and keep the whole log
	You can either run a process with a short log, as this example will explain, or run your own process and keep the full log as described at http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/manuals/workqueue.html

	For our purposes

2.) Convert the log to a viable form.
	If you just ran work_queue to obtain a log, the log will be new enough to use. If you skipped step 1 and
	though "I'll just use an old log from an old work_queue process", convert it using:
	python log_converter.py your_log filename_for_converted_log
3.) Run visualize.py
	To create the actual gif, run:
	python visualize.py viable_log_name output_gif_name
	where output_gif_name does not need a ".gif" extension. This process may take awhile
