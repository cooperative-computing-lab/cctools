There is an example of a gif included in this directory for your viewing pleasure.
There is a converted log and an unconverted, old format log found under WQ_logs. You can start this example on step 3 with the converted log.

To make a gif visualization of a work_queue process given just cctools and the required dependencies (see README), do the following:

1.) Run a work_queue process and keep the whole log
	Move to the directory in cctools/work_queue/apps/work_queue_visualization/example (where you are reading this file)
	You can either run a process with a short log, as this example will explain, or run your own process and keep the full log as described at http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/manuals/workqueue.html

	For this example, run:

	python work_queue_example.py dummy_file1.txt dummy_file2.txt dummy_file3.txt

	This will create a log call "wq.log". Now, you'll want to:

	cd ..

	to get out of the example directory and back to the
	cctools/apps/work_queue_visualization directory.

2.) Convert the log to a viable form.
	If you just ran work_queue to obtain a log and have cctools version 4.4+, the log will be new enough to use. If you skipped step 1 and
	though "I'll just use an old log from an old work_queue process", or have cctools version 4.3 or lower and somehow have this tool, convert the log using:
	python log_converter.py your_log filename_for_converted_log

3.) Run visualize.py
	To create the actual gif, run:

	python visualize.py viable_log_name output_gif_name

	where output_gif_name does not need a ".gif" extension. This process may take awhile.
	In this example, the exact line would be:

	python visualize.py example/wq.log trial

	and the gif would be found at trial.gif

4.) View the animation
	Use ffmpeg or a browser to view the actual animation you created, trial.gif
