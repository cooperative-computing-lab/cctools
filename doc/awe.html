<h2>Overview</h2>

Adaptive Weighted Ensemble or AWE package provides a Python library for adaptive
sampling of molecular dynamics. The framework decomposes the resampling
computations and the molecular dynamics simulations into tasks that are
dispatched to <a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/software/workqueue/">Work
Queue</a> for execution on resources allocated from clusters, clouds, grids, or
any idle machines.

<p>AWE is part of the <a href=http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/software>Cooperating
Computing Tools</a>. It is available in the CCTools Source Package which can be
downloaded from <a href=http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/software/download>this web
page</a>.

<h2>Software Requirements</h2>
AWE currently uses the GROMACS molecular dynamics simulation package. So it
requires an installation of GROMACS 4.5 or above and its installed location
added to PATH. It also requires the GROMACS XTC library for operation. 

<p>
The software requirements of AWE are summarized below along with how AWE finds
and accesses them:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Software</th><th>Version</th><th>Accessed using</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://python.org">Python</a></td><td>2.6 or higher</td><td>PATH</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.gromacs.org">GROMACS</a></td><td>4.5 or higher</td><td>PATH</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a

<h2>Building and Installing AWE</h2>
Download the CCTools source package from this <a
href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/software/download">web page</a> and install
using the steps <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ccl/software/manuals/install.html">here</a>. 

<p> 
To build and install AWE, use the following recipe.

First, determine the location where AWE is to be installed. For example:
<pre>
% export AWE_INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/awe
</pre>

Compile and install AWE in the location pointed by $AWE_INSTALL_PATH using:
<pre>
% cd cctools-xxx-src
% cd apps/awe
% ./configure --prefix $AWE_INSTALL_PATH
% make install
</pre>

Now set PATH to include the installed AWE binaries:
<pre>
% export PATH=${PATH}:${AWE_INSTALL_PATH}:${PATH}
</pre>

Finally, set PYTHONPATH to include the installed AWE Python modules:
<pre>
% export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${AWE_INSTALL_PATH}/lib/python2.6/site-packages
</pre>

You can also check if AWE was correctly installed by running:
<pre>
% awe-verify
</pre>

<h2>Running AWE</h2>

To run AWE to sample a protein molecule, you will need to have the files
describing the topology of atoms in that molecule, the coordinates of the
walkers, and the coordinates of the cells. 

<p>In addition, AWE transfers the executables from the GROMACS package required for
running the simulations of each walker. This can be fetched to the current
working directory by running 
 
<pre>
% awe-prepare
</pre>

<p>This will create a directory named <tt>awe-generic-data</tt> and copy files that
all AWE runs will require (namely the binaries and Gromacs forcefield files).

<p>The AWE source also includes an example program that samples the state
transitions for the Alanine Dipeptide protein. To run this example, do

<pre>
% python example.py
</pre>

<p> You will see this right away:
<pre>
 Running on port 9123...
 Loading cells and walkers
</pre>

The AWE master program successfully started and is loading the cells and walkers
for running the simulations. After that, the master waits for workers to connect
so it can dispatch the simulation tasks for execution by the connected workers.

Now, start a worker for this master on the same machine:
<pre>
% work_queue_worker localhost 9123
</pre>

However, to run a really large sampling, you will need to run as many workers as
possible.  A simple (but tiresome) way of doing so is to <tt>ssh</tt> into
several machines and manually run <tt>work_queue_worker</tt> as above.  But, if
you have access to a batch system like <a
href=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor>Condor</a> or <a
href=http://www.sun.com/software/sge>SGE</a>, you can use them to start many
workers with a single submit command.

<p>
We have provided some scripts to make this easy.  For example, to submit 10
workers to your local Condor pool:

<pre>
% condor_submit_workers master.somewhere.edu 9123 10
Submitting job(s)..........
Logging submit event(s)..........
10 job(s) submitted to cluster 298.
</pre>

Or, to submit 10 worker processes to your SGE cluster:
<pre>
% sge_submit_workers master.somewhere.edu 9123 10
Your job 1054781 ("worker.sh") has been submitted
Your job 1054782 ("worker.sh") has been submitted
Your job 1054783 ("worker.sh") has been submitted
...
</pre>

Note that <tt>condor_submit_workers</tt> and <tt>sge_submit_workers</tt>
are simple shell scripts, so you can edit them directly if you would
like to change batch options or other details.
<p>
Once the workers begin running, the AWE master can dispatch tasks to
each one very quickly.  It's ok if a machine running a worker crashes
or is turned off; the work will be silently sent elsewhere to run.
<p>
When the AWE master process completes, your workers will
still be available, so you can either run another master with the
same workers, remove them from the batch system, or wait for them to
expire.  If you do nothing for 15 minutes, they will automatically exit.
