<h1>Tutorial: JX Workflow Language</h1>

</p>

<p>
This is a gentle introduction to the JX workflow language, which
is the "advanced" language used by the <a href=makeflow.html>Makeflow</a>
workflow engine.  JX is an extension of standard <a href=http://json.org>JSON</a> expressions, so if you are familiar with those from another language,
you will find it easy to get started.
</p>

<p>
To use these examples, you will first need to install the <a href=makeflow.html>Makeflow</a> workflow engine and ensure that the <tt>makeflow</tt> command
is in your <tt>PATH</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Hello World</h2>

<p>
Let's begin by creating a simple workflow that executes exactly one task,
which outputs the text "hello world".  Enter the following workflow
using your favorite text editor and save it into a file called <tt>example.jx</tt>:
</p>

<code>{
   "rules": [
      {
          "command" : "echo hello world > output.txt",
          "outputs" : [ "output.txt" ],
          "inputs" : [ ],
      }
   ]
}
</code>

<p>
Now run it locally with the following command:
</p>

<code>makeflow --jx example.jx
</code>

<p>
You should see some output like this:
</p>

<code>parsing example.jx...
local resources: 4 cores, 15774 MB memory, 2097151 MB disk
max running local jobs: 4
checking example.jx for consistency...
example.jx has 1 rules.
starting workflow....
submitting job: echo hello world > output.txt
submitted job 29955
job 29955 completed
nothing left to do.
</code>

<p>
Now examine the file <tt>output.txt</tt> and you should see that it contains "hello world".  Congratulations, you have run your first workflow!
</p>

<h2>Defining Values</h2>

<p>
JX allows you to programmatically define elements of your workflow,
using expressions to substitute in for parts of jobs.  The general
structure of a workflow is this:
</p>

<code>{
   "define": {
      # symbol definitions go here
   },

   "rules": [
      # rules go here
   ]
}
</code>

<p>
Building on the previous example, suppose that you want to 
parameterize the message constant called <tt>message</tt>
To do that, define it in the <tt>define</tt> section, and
then concatentate <tt>message</tt> into the job, like this:
</p>

<code>{
   <b>"define": {
      "message" : "hello world!"
   },
</b>
   "rules": [
      {
          "command" : "echo "<b>+message+</b>" > output.txt",
          "outputs" : [ "output.txt" ],
          "inputs" : [ ],
      }
   ]
}
</code>

To test out this change, first clean the workflow:

<code>makeflow --jx example.jx --clean
</code>

And then run it again:

<code>makeflow --jx example.jx
</code>

(For the remainder of the examples in this tutorial, we will assume that you clean the workflow first, and then run it again.)

<h2>Generating Multiple Jobs</h2>

<p>
A common use of workflows is to drive a large number of simulation
or analysis codes.  Suppose that you have a custom simulation code
called <tt>simulate.py</tt> which takes a command line argument
<tt>-n</tt> and produces its output on the console.
To run one instance of that simulator, you could do this:
</p>

<code>{
   "rules": [
      {
         "command" : "./simulate.py -n 1 > output.txt",
         "inputs" : [ "simulate.py" ],
         "outputs" : [ "output.txt" ],
      }
   ]
}
</code>

<p>
(Note that the simulator code itself is treated as an input file,
so that the code can be copied to the target execution machine as needed.)
</p>

<p>
If you wanted to run three simulations with slightly different arguments,
you could simply write each one out longhand, giving each one a different
command line argument and sending output to a different file:
</p>
 
<code>{
   "rules": [
      {
         "command" : "./simulate.py -n 1 > output.1.txt",
         "inputs" : [ "simulate.py" ],
         "outputs" : [ "output.1.txt" ],
      },
      {
         "command" : "./simulate.py -n 2 > output.2.txt",
         "inputs" : [ "simulate.py" ],
         "outputs" : [ "output.2.txt" ],
      },
      {
         "command" : "./simulate.py -n 3 > output.3.txt",
         "inputs" : [ "simulate.py" ],
         "outputs" : [ "output.3.txt" ],
      }
   ]
}

</code>

But of course that would be tiresome for a large number of jobs.
Instead, you can write out the job once and use the <tt>for</tt> operator
(sometimes known as a <i>list comprehension</i>) to generate multiple
instance of the job:

<code>{
   "rules": [
      {
         "command" : "./simulate.py -n "<b>+N+</b>" > output."<b>+N+</b>".txt",
         "inputs" : [ "simulate.py" ],
         "outputs" : [ "output."<b>+N+</b>".txt" ],
      } <b>for N in [ 1, 2, 3 ]</b>
   ]
}
</code>

Note that the value of <tt>N</tt> is substituted into both the commands
string and the output list by using the plus sign to indicate string
concatenation.  If you prefer a more <tt>printf</tt> style, you can
use the <tt>format()</tt> function to insert values into strings
into places indicate by percent codes:

<code>{
   "rules": [
      {
         "command" : <b>format("./simulate.py -n %d > output.%d.txt",N,N)</b>
         "inputs" : [ "simulate.py" ],
         "outputs" : [ "output."+N+".txt" ],
      } for N in [ 1, 2, 3 ]
   ]
}
</code>

If you want to preview how these list comprehensions expand into
individual jobs, use the program <tt>jx2json</tt> to reduce the
JX program into plain JSON:

<code>
jx2json example.jx
</code>

Which should produce output like this:

<code>
{"rules":[{"command":"./simulate.py -n 1 > output.1.txt","inputs":["simulate.py"],"outputs":["output.1.txt"]},{"command":"./simulate.py -n 2 > output.2.txt","inputs":["simulate.py"],"outputs":["output.2.txt"]},{"command":"./simulate.py -n 3 > output.3.txt","inputs":["simulate.py"],"outputs":["output.3.txt"]}]}
</code>

<h2>Gather Results</h2>

So far, out example workflow will run three simulations independently.
But suppose you want the workflow to have a final step which
runs after all the simulations are complete, to collect the results
in a single file called <tt>output.all.txt</tt>.  You could
write it out longhand for three files explicitly:

<code>{
   "command" : "cat output.1.txt output.2.txt output.3.txt > output.all",
   "inputs" : [ "output.1.txt", "output.2.txt", "output.3.txt" ],
   "outputs" : [ "output.all.txt" ],
}
</code>

Of course, it would be better to generate the list automatically.
The list of output files is easy: just generate them using
a list comprehension.  For example, this expression:

<code>[ "output."+N+".txt" for N in [1,2,3] ]
</code>

Would evaluate to this array:
<code>["output.1.txt","output.2.txt","output.3.txt"]
</code>

The command line string is a little trickier, because we want
a string containing all of those filenames, rather than the array.
The <tt>join()</tt> function is used to join an array into a single string.
For example, this expression:

<code>join(["output.1.txt","output.2.txt","output.3.txt"]," ")
</code>

Evaluates to this string:

<code>"output.1.txt output.2.txt output.3.txt"
</code>

We can put all of those bits into a single job, like this:

<code>{
   "command" : "cat "+join(["output."+N+".txt" for N in [1,2,3]])+" >output.all.txt",
   "inputs" : [ "output."+N+".txt" for N in [ 1, 2, 3 ] ],
   "outputs" : [ "output.all.txt" ],
}
</code>

That is correct, but it's rather hard to read.  Instead, we can
make things clearer by factoring out the definition of the list
and the range to the <tt>define</tt> section of the workflow.
Putting it all together, we have this:

<code>{
   "define": {
      "RANGE" : range(1,3),
      "FILELIST" : ["output."+N+".txt for N in RANGE],
   },

   "rules": [
      {
        "command" : "./simulate.py -n "+N+" > output."+N+".txt",
        "inputs" : [ "simulate.py" ],
        "outputs" : [ "output."+N+".txt" ],
      } for N in RANGE,
      {
        "command" : "cat "+join(FILELIST," ")+" >output.all.txt",
        "inputs" : [ FILELIST ],
        "outputs" : [ "output.all.txt" ],
      }
   ]
}
</code>
