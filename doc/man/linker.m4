SECTION(NAME)
BOLD(makeflow_linker) - automatic dependency location for workflows

SECTION(SYNOPSIS)
CODE(BOLD(makeflow_linker [options] PARAM(workflow_description)))

SECTION(DESCRIPTION)
BOLD(makeflow_linker) is a tool for automatically determining dependencies of workflows. It accepts a workflow description, currently Makeflow syntax is required, and recursively determines the dependencies and produces a self-contained package. BOLD(makeflow_linker) supports Python, Perl, and shared libraries. 

PARA

BOLD(makeflow_linker) finds dependencies by static analysis. CODE(eval) and other dynamic code loading may obscure dependencies causing BOLD(makeflow_linker) to miss some critical dependencies. Therefore it is recommended to avoid these techniques when desiging a workflow.

SECTION(OPTIONS)
OPTIONS_BEGIN
OPTION_ITEM(`-h, --help')Show this help screen.
OPTION_TRIPLET(-o, output, directory)Specify output directory
OPTIONS_END

SECTION(EXIT STATUS)
On success, returns zero. On failure (typically permission errors), returns non-zero.

SECTION(BUGS)
LIST_BEGIN
LIST_ITEM The makeflow_linker does not check for naming collisions beyond the initial workflow inputs.
LIST_ITEM The makeflow_linker relies on regex parsing of files, so some forms of import statements may be missing.
LIST_END
