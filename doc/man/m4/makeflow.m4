SECTION(NAME)
BOLD(makeflow) - workflow engine for executing distributed workflows

SECTION(SYNOPSIS)
CODE(makeflow [options] PARAM(dagfile))

SECTION(DESCRIPTION)

BOLD(Makeflow) is a workflow engine for distributed computing. It accepts a
specification of a large amount of work to be performed, and runs it on remote
machines in parallel where possible. In addition, BOLD(Makeflow) is
fault-tolerant, so you can use it to coordinate very large tasks that may run
for days or weeks in the face of failures. BOLD(Makeflow) is designed to be
similar to Make, so if you can write a Makefile, then you can write a
BOLD(Makeflow).

PARA

You can run a BOLD(Makeflow) on your local machine to test it out. If you have
a multi-core machine, then you can run multiple tasks simultaneously. If you
have a Condor pool or a Sun Grid Engine batch system, then you can send your
jobs there to run. If you don't already have a batch system, BOLD(Makeflow)
comes with a system called Work Queue that will let you distribute the load
across any collection of machines, large or small.  BOLD(Makeflow) also
supports execution in a Docker container, regardless of the batch system
used.

PARA

SECTION(OPTIONS)

workflow specified by the BOLD(Makeflow) dagfile using the CODE(local)

SECTION(DRYRUN MODE)

When the batch system is set to BOLD(-T) PARAM(dryrun), Makeflow runs as usual
but does not actually execute jobs or modify the system. This is useful to
check that wrappers and substitutions are applied as expected. In addition,
Makeflow will write an equivalent shell script to the batch system log
specified by BOLD(-L) PARAM(logfile). This script will run the commands in
serial that Makeflow would have run. This shell script format may be useful
for archival purposes, since it does not depend on Makeflow.

SECTION(MPI MODE)

When cctools is built with the --with-mpi-path configuration, Makeflow can be ran as an MPI program.
To do so, run Makeflow as an argument to BOLD(mpirun)/BOLD(mpiexec) and set BOLD(-T) PARAM(mpi) as a Makeflow option.
When submitting mpi, request one process per core. Makeflow will count up how many processes each node given to MPI
has, and use that as the core count for the worker on that node. Makeflow will then share memory evenly amongst the cores
on the node, following the following equation BOLD(worker_memory) = (BOLD(total_memory) / BOLD(total_logical_cores)) * BOLD(num_cores_for_worker).
To override Makeflow sharing memory equally, or setting per-worker cores value, use CODE(--mpi-cores) and CODE(--mpi-memory).

Tasks can also have their own sandbox. To specify the directory for tasks to create their sandbox subdirectory in, use CODE(--mpi-task-working-dir).

SECTION(ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES)

The following environment variables will affect the execution of your
BOLD(Makeflow):
SUBSECTION(BATCH_OPTIONS)

This corresponds to the BOLD(-B) PARAM(options) parameter and will pass extra
batch options to the underlying execution engine.

SUBSECTION(MAKEFLOW_MAX_LOCAL_JOBS)
This corresponds to the BOLD(-j) PARAM(#) parameter and will set the maximum
number of local batch jobs.  If a BOLD(-j) PARAM(#) parameter is specified, the
minimum of the argument and the environment variable is used.

SUBSECTION(MAKEFLOW_MAX_REMOTE_JOBS)
This corresponds to the BOLD(-J) PARAM(#) parameter and will set the maximum
number of local batch jobs.  If a BOLD(-J) PARAM(#) parameter is specified, the
minimum of the argument and the environment variable is used.
PARA
Note that variables defined in your BOLD(Makeflow) are exported to the
environment.

SUBSECTION(TCP_LOW_PORT)
Inclusive low port in range used with CODE(-p 0).

SUBSECTION(TCP_HIGH_PORT))
Inclusive high port in range used with CODE(-p 0).

SECTION(EXIT STATUS)
On success, returns zero.  On failure, returns non-zero.

SECTION(EXAMPLES)

LONGCODE_BEGIN
makeflow -d all Makeflow
LONGCODE_END

Run makeflow on Condor will special requirements:
LONGCODE_BEGIN
makeflow -T condor -B "requirements = MachineGroup == 'ccl'" Makeflow
