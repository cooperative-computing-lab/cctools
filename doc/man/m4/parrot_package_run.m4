SECTION(NAME)
BOLD(parrot_package_run) - repeat a program within the package with the help of CODE(parrot_run)

SECTION(SYNOPSIS)
CODE(parrot_package_run --package-path your-package-path [command])

SECTION(DESCRIPTION)
If CODE(parrot_run) is used to repeat one experiment, one mountlist must be created so that the file access request of your program can be redirected into the package. CODE(parrot_package_run) is used to create the mountlist and repeat your program within the package with the help of CODE(parrot_run) and BOLD(mountlist). If no command is given, a /bin/sh shell will be returned.

SECTION(OPTIONS)
OPTIONS_BEGIN
OPTION_FLAG(p,package-path)The path of the package.
OPTION_FLAG(e,env-list)The path of the environment file, each line is in the format of PARAM(key)=PARAM(value). (Default: package-path/env_list)
OPTION_FLAG(e,env-list)The path of the environment file, each line is in the format of PARAM(key)=PARAM(value). (Default: package-path/env_list)
OPTION_FLAG(h,help)Show this help message.
OPTIONS_END

SECTION(EXIT STATUS)
On success, returns zero. On failure, returns non-zero.

SECTION(EXAMPLES)
To repeat one program within one package BOLD(/tmp/package) in a BOLD(bash) shell:
LONGCODE_BEGIN
% parrot_package_run --package-path /tmp/package /bin/bash
LONGCODE_END
After the execution of this command, one shell will be returned, where you can repeat your original program. After everything is done, exit CODE(parrot_package_run):
LONGCODE_BEGIN
% exit
LONGCODE_END
You can also directly set your command as the arguments of CODE(parrot_package_run). In this case, CODE(parrot_package_run) will exit automatically after the command is finished, and you do not need to use CODE(exit) to exit. However, your command must belong to the original command set executed inside CODE(parrot_run) and preserved by CODE(parrot_package_create).
LONGCODE_BEGIN
% parrot_package_run --package-path /tmp/package ls -al
LONGCODE_END

Here is a short instruction about how to make use of CODE(parrot_run), CODE(parrot_package_create) and CODE(parrot_package_run)
to generate one package for your experiment and repeat your experiment within your package.
PARA
Step 1: Run your program under CODE(parrot_run) and using BOLD(--name-list) and BOLD(--env-list) parameters to
record the filename list and environment variables.
LONGCODE_BEGIN
% parrot_run --name-list namelist --env-list envlist /bin/bash
LONGCODE_END
After the execution of this command, you can run your program inside CODE(parrot_run). At the end of step 1, one file named BOLD(namelist) containing all the accessed file names and one file named BOLD(envlist) containing environment variables will be generated.
After everything is done, exit CODE(parrot_run):
LONGCODE_BEGIN
% exit
LONGCODE_END
PARA
Step 2: Using CODE(parrot_package_create) to generate a package.
LONGCODE_BEGIN
% parrot_package_create --name-list namelist --env-path envlist --package-path /tmp/package
LONGCODE_END
At the end of step 2, one package with the path of BOLD(/tmp/package) will be generated.
PARA
Step 3: Repeat your program within your package.
LONGCODE_BEGIN
% parrot_package_run --package-path /tmp/package /bin/bash
LONGCODE_END
After the execution of this command, one shell will be returned, where you can repeat your original program. After everything is done, exit CODE(parrot_package_run):
LONGCODE_BEGIN
% exit
LONGCODE_END
