SECTION(NAME)
BOLD(sge_submit_workers) - submit work_queue_worker to a SUN Grid Engine (SGE).

SECTION(SYNOPSIS)

when auto mode is not enabled for the worker, or

CODE(sge_submit_workers [options] PARAM(num-workers))

when auto mode is enabled for the worker.

SECTION(DESCRIPTION)
CODE(sge_submit_workers) schedules the execution of MANPAGE(work_queue_worker,1)
on the SUN Grid Engine (SGE) through its job submission interface, qsub.
The number of BOLD(work_queue_worker) scheduled and run is given by the BOLD(num-workers)
argument.

The BOLD(servername) and BOLD(port) arguments specify the hostname and port number of the
manager for the work_queue_worker to connect. These two arguments become optional when the
auto mode option is specified for work_queue_worker.
