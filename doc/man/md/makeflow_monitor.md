# makeflow_monitor(1)

## NAME
**makeflow_monitor** - Makeflow log monitor

## SYNOPSIS
**makeflow_monitor [options] _&lt;makeflowlog&gt;_**

## DESCRIPTION
**makeflow_monitor** is simple **Makeflow** log monitor that displays the
progress and statistics of a workflow based on the provided _&lt;makeflowlog&gt;_.
Once started, it will continually monitor the specified _&lt;makeflowlogs&gt;_ for
new events and update the progress display.

## OPTIONS

- **-h**<br />Show this help message and exit.
- **-f** _&lt;format&gt;_<br />Output format to emit.
- **-t** _&lt;seconds&gt;_<br />Timeout for reading the logs.
- **-m** _&lt;minimum&gt;_<br />Mininum number of tasks.
- **-S**<br />Sort logs by progress.
- **-P**<br />Parse dag for node information.
- **-H**<br />Hide finished makeflows.


Currently, the only supported _&lt;format&gt;_ is "text", which means
**makeflow_monitor** will display the progress of the workflows directly to
the console.

Additionally, the **-P** parameter current does not do anything.

## EXIT STATUS
On success, returns zero.  On failure, returns non-zero.

## EXAMPLES
Monitor a **Makeflow** log:
```
makeflow_monitor Makeflow.makeflowlog
```
Monitor multiple **Makeflow** logs and hide finished workflows:
```
makeflow_monitor -H */*.makeflowlog
```
Monitor multiple **Makeflow** logs under current directory and only display
currently running workflows with a minimum of 4 tasks:
```
find . -name '*.makeflowlog' | xargs makeflow_monitor -m 4 -H
```
The example above is useful for hierarchical workflows.
