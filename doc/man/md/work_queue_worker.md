# work_queue_worker(1)

## NAME
**work_queue_worker** - worker process for executing tasks
dispatched through Work Queue

## SYNOPSIS
**work_queue_worker [options] _&lt;managerhost&gt;_ _&lt;port&gt;_**

**work_queue_worker [options] _&lt;managerhost:port]&gt;_**

**work_queue_worker [options] "_&lt;managerhost:port;[managerhost:port;managerhost:port;...]&gt;_**)

**work_queue_worker [options] -M _&lt;projectname&gt;_**

## DESCRIPTION

**work_queue_worker** is the worker process for executing tasks dispatched
from a manager application built using the **Work Queue** API. **work_queue_worker**
connects to the manager application, accepts, runs, and returns tasks dispatched to it.



The **managerhost** and **port** arguments specify the hostname and port
number of the manager application for work_queue_worker to connect. Several
managerhosts and ports may be specified, separated with a semicolon (;), with the
worker connecting to any of the managers specified (When specifying multiple
managers, remember to escape the ; from shell interpretation, for example, using
quotes.)

Alternatevely, the manager may be specified by name, using the **-M** option.



**work_queue_worker** can be run locally or deployed remotely on any of the
grid or cloud computing environments such as SGE, PBS, SLURM, and HTCondor using
[sge_submit_workers(1)](sge_submit_workers.md), [pbs_submit_workers(1)](pbs_submit_workers.md), [slurm_submit_workers()](slurm_submit_workers.md), and [condor_submit_workers(1)](condor_submit_workers.md) respectively.

- **-i**,**--min-backoff=_&lt;time&gt;_**<br />Set initial value for backoff interval when worker fails to connect to a manager. (default=1s)
- **-b**,**--max-backoff=_&lt;time&gt;_**<br />Set maxmimum value for backoff interval when worker fails to connect to a manager. (default=60s)
- **-A**,**--arch=_&lt;arch&gt;_**<br />Set the architecture string the worker reports to its supervisor. (default=the value reported by uname)
- **-O**,**--os=_&lt;os&gt;_**<br />Set the operating system string the worker reports to its supervisor. (default=the value reported by uname)
- **-s**,**--workdir=_&lt;path&gt;_**<br />Set the location where the worker should create its working directory. (default=/tmp)
- **--bandwidth=_&lt;mbps&gt;_**<br />Set the maximum bandwidth the foreman will consume in Mbps. (default=unlimited)
- **--cores=_&lt;n&gt;_**<br />Set the number of cores this worker should use.  Set it to 0 to have the worker use all of the available resources. (default=1)
- **--gpus=_&lt;n&gt;_**<br />Set the number of GPUs this worker should use. If less than 0 or not given, try to detect gpus available.
- **--memory=_&lt;mb&gt;_**<br />Manually set the amount of memory (in MB) reported by this worker.
- **--disk=_&lt;mb&gt;_**<br />Manually set the amount of disk space (in MB) reported by this worker.
- **--wall-time=_&lt;s&gt;_**<br />Set the maximum number of seconds the worker may be active.
- **--feature=_&lt;feature&gt;_**<br />Specifies a user-defined feature the worker provides (option can be repeated).

## FOREMAN MODE

**work_queue_worker** can also be run in **foreman** mode, in which it connects to a
manager as a worker while acting as a manager itself.  Any tasks the foreman receives from
its manager are sent to its subordinate worker processes.



**Foreman** mode is enabled by either specifying a port to listen on using the **--foreman --foreman-port _&lt;port&gt;_** option or by
setting the mode directly with the **--foreman --foreman-name _&lt;foreman_name&gt;_**
option.  The foreman works for the manager specified with the with the **-M _&lt;project name&gt;_** flag.

## EXIT STATUS
On success, returns zero.  On failure, returns non-zero.

## EXAMPLES

To run **work_queue_worker** to join a specific manager process running on host **manager.somewhere.edu** port 9123:
```
% work_queue_worker manager.somewhere.edu 9123
```

To run **work_queue_worker** in auto mode with debugging turned on for all subsystems and
to accept tasks only from a manager application with project name set to project_A:
```
% work_queue_worker -a -d all -M project_A
```

To run **work_queue_worker** as a foreman working for project_A and advertising itself as foreman_A1:
```
% work_queue_worker --foreman -M project_A -f foreman_A1
```
