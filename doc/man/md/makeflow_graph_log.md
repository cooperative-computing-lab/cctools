# makeflow_graph_log(1)

## NAME
**makeflow_graph_log** - convert a makeflow log into a graph

## SYNOPSIS
**makeflow_graph_log _&lt;logfile&gt;_ _&lt;imagefile&gt;_**

## DESCRIPTION

**makeflow_graph_log** converts a makeflow log into a graph
that shows the number of tasks ready, running, and completed over time.
The output graph is generated by using gnuplot to create a postscript
file, which is then converted to the desired type using ImageMagick.
The type of the output file is determined by the name, so any image
type supported by ImageMagick can be selected.

## OPTIONS
None.

```
