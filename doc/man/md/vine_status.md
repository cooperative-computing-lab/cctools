more detailed information about tasks and workers.

## EXAMPLES

Without arguments, **vine_status** shows a summary of all of the
projects currently reporting to the default catalog server. Waiting, running,
and complete columns refer to number of tasks:

```
$ vine_status
PROJECT            HOST                   PORT WAITING RUNNING COMPLETE WORKERS
shrimp             cclws16.cse.nd.edu     9001     963      37        2      33
crustacea          terra.solar.edu        9000       0    2310    32084     700
```

With the **-R** option, a summary of the resources available to each manager is shown:

```
$ vine_status -R
MANAGER                         CORES      MEMORY          DISK
shrimp                         228        279300          932512
crustacea                      4200       4136784         9049985
```

With the **--capacity** option, a summary of the resource capacities for each manager is shown:

```
$ vine_status --capacity
MANAGER                         TASKS      CORES      MEMORY          DISK
refine                         ???        ???        ???             ???
shrimp                         99120      99120      781362960       1307691584

```

Use the **-W** option to list the workers connected to a particular manager.
Completed and running columns refer to numbers of tasks:

```
$ vine_status -W cclws16.cse.nd.edu 9001
HOST                     ADDRESS          COMPLETED RUNNING
mccourt02.helios.nd.edu  10.176.48.102:40         0 4
cse-ws-23.cse.nd.edu     129.74.155.120:5         0 0
mccourt50.helios.nd.edu  10.176.63.50:560         4 4

```

With the **-T** option, a list of all the tasks submitted to the manager is shown:

```
$ vine_status -T cclws16.cse.nd.edu 9001
ID       STATE    PRIORITY HOST                     COMMAND
1000     WAITING         0 ???                      ./rmapper-cs -M fast -M 50bp 1
999      WAITING         0 ???                      ./rmapper-cs -M fast -M 50bp 1
21       running         0 cse-ws-35.cse.nd.edu     ./rmapper-cs -M fast -M 50bp 3
20       running         0 cse-ws-35.cse.nd.edu     ./rmapper-cs -M fast -M 50bp 2
19       running         0 cse-ws-35.cse.nd.edu     ./rmapper-cs -M fast -M 50bp 2
18       running         0 cse-ws-35.cse.nd.edu     ./rmapper-cs -M fast -M 50bp 2
...
```


The **-A** option shows a summary of the resources observed per task
category.

```
$ vine_status -A cclws16.cse.nd.edu 9001
CATEGORY        RUNNING    WAITING  FIT-WORKERS  MAX-CORES MAX-MEMORY   MAX-DISK
analysis            216        784           54          4      ~1011      ~3502
merge                20         92           30         ~1      ~4021      21318
default               1         25           54         >1       ~503       >243
```

With the -A option:

- Running and waiting correspond to number of tasks in the category.
- Fit-workers shows the number of connected workers able to run the largest task in the category.
- max-cores, max-memory, and max-disk show the corresponding largest value in the category.


The value may have the following prefixes:

- No prefix. The maximum value was manually specified.
- ~ All the task have run with at most this quantity of resources.
- ï¼ž There is at least one task that has used more than this quantity of resources, but the maximum remains unknown.



Finally, the **-l** option shows statistics of the manager in a JSON object:

```
$ vine_status -l cclws16.cse.nd.edu 9001
{"categories":[{"max_disk":"3500","max_memory":"1024","max_cores":"1",...
```

## EXIT STATUS
On success, returns zero.  On failure, returns non-zero.
