## NAME
**starch** - STandalone application ARCHiver

## SYNOPSIS
**starch [options] _&lt;sfx_path&gt;_**

## DESCRIPTION

**Starch** is a script that creates standalone application archives in the
form of self-extracting executables (**SFX**). Users may specify the command,
executables, libraries, data, and environment scripts associated with the
application by specifying the appropriate command line options or by using a
configuration file.  **starch** is particularly useful for distributed
computing, in that it makes an executable portable across different
operating system variants.

## OPTIONS

To create a **SFX**, simply specify the name of the **SFX** to create along
with the _&lt;command&gt;_ to execute and any other dependencies such as
_&lt;executables&gt;_, _&lt;libraries&gt;_, _&lt;data&gt;_, or _&lt;environment&gt;_
scripts.

If a _&lt;command&gt;_ is specified, but no _&lt;executable&gt;_ is passed, then the
first token in the _&lt;command&gt;_ will be used as the executable.

By default, **starch** will use **ldd** to detect any necessary libraries
from the specified set of _&lt;executables&gt;_ and include them in the **SFX**.

- **-A**<br />Do not automatically detect library dependencies.
- **-C** _&lt;cfg&gt;_<br />Use configuration file.
- **-c** _&lt;cmd&gt;_<br />Specify command to execute.
- **-d** _&lt;npath:opath&gt;_<br />Add data (new path:old path).
- **-e** _&lt;env&gt;_<br />Add environment script.
- **-l** _&lt;lib&gt;_<br />Add library.
- **-x** _&lt;exe&gt;_<br />Add executable.
- **-h**<br />Show help message and exit.
- **-v**<br />Display verbose messages (default: False).

Once a **SFX** is generated, you can use it as a normal executable.

## CONFIGURATION FILE
The command line options may be stored in a configuration file and passed to
starch using the **starch -C** option.  The format of the configuration file is as
follows:
```
[starch]
executables = echo date hostname
libraries   = libz.so
data        = hosts.txt:/etc/hosts localtime:/etc/localtime images:/usr/share/pixmaps
command     = echo $(hostname) $(date $@)
```

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following environment variables will affect the execution of the **SFX**
generated by **starch**:

### SFX_DIR
Determines the target directory where the **SFX** will be extracted.  By
default this is **/tmp/$hostname.$user.$basename.dir**.

### SFX_EXTRACT_ONLY
Only extract the **SFX**.  By default it is extracted and executed.

### SFX_EXTRACT_FORCE
Extract the **SFX** even if the **SFX_DIR** exists. This is disabled by
default to as an optimization to avoid unnecessarily extracting.

### SFX_KEEP
Keep extracted files.  By default the files will be removed after execution.

### SFX_UNIQUE

Use **mktempd** to generate a unique **SFX_DIR** target directory. This
will prevent **SFX_KEEP** from working properly since the names will change
in between invocations.

## EXIT STATUS
On success, returns zero.  On failure, returns non-zero.

## EXAMPLES

Package the date program:
```
    $ starch -c date -x date date.sfx
```

Package the date program using a configuration file:
```
    $ cat data.cfg
    [starch]
    executables = date
    command = date
    $ starch -C date.cfg date.sfx
```

Run standalone date program with parameters:
```
    $ ./date.sfx +%s
```

Only extract the archive:
```
    $ env SFX_EXTRACT_ONLY=1 ./date.sfx
```

Run and keep extracted directory:
```
    $ env SFX_KEEP=1 ./date.sfx
```

Run with unique directory:
```
    $ env SFX_UNIQUE=1 ./date.sfx
```

Advanced example involving a complex shell command:
```
    $ starch -v -x tar -x rm  -c 'tar_test() { for f in $@; do if ! tar xvf $f; then exit 1; fi; done; rm $@'; }; tar_test' extract_and_remove.sfx
    $ ./extract_and_remove.sfx *.tar.gz
```
