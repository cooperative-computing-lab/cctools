## NAME
**makeflow** - workflow engine for executing distributed workflows

## SYNOPSIS
****makeflow [options] <dagfile>****

## DESCRIPTION

**Makeflow** is a workflow engine for distributed computing. It accepts a
specification of a large amount of work to be performed, and runs it on remote
machines in parallel where possible. In addition, **Makeflow** is
fault-tolerant, so you can use it to coordinate very large tasks that may run
for days or weeks in the face of failures. **Makeflow** is designed to be
similar to Make, so if you can write a Makefile, then you can write a
**Makeflow**.



You can run a **Makeflow** on your local machine to test it out. If you have
a multi-core machine, then you can run multiple tasks simultaneously. If you
have a Condor pool or a Sun Grid Engine batch system, then you can send your
jobs there to run. If you don't already have a batch system, **Makeflow**
comes with a system called Work Queue that will let you distribute the load
across any collection of machines, large or small.  **Makeflow** also
supports execution in a Docker container, regardless of the batch system
used.

workflow specified by the **Makeflow** dagfile using the **local**
execution engine.

## DRYRUN MODE

When the batch system is set to **-T** <dryrun>, Makeflow runs as usual
but does not actually execute jobs or modify the system. This is useful to
check that wrappers and substitutions are applied as expected. In addition,
Makeflow will write an equivalent shell script to the batch system log
specified by **-L** <logfile>. This script will run the commands in
serial that Makeflow would have run. This shell script format may be useful
for archival purposes, since it does not depend on Makeflow.

## MPI
When cctools is built with --with-mpi-path=which mpicc` configuration, Makeflow can be ran as an MPI program.
To do so, run Makeflow as an argument to BOLD(mpirun)/BOLD(mpiexec) and set BOLD(-T) PARAM(mpi) as a Makeflow option.
When submitting mpi, request one process per core. Makeflow will count up how many processes each node given to MPI
has, and use that as the core count for the worker on that node. Makeflow will then share memory evenly amongst the cores
on the node, following the following equation BOLD(worker_memory) = (BOLD(total_memory) / BOLD(total_logical_cores)) * BOLD(num_cores_for_worker).
To override Makeflow sharing memory equally, or setting per-worker cores value, use OPTION_ITEM('--mpi-cores) and - **'--mpi-memory'** .

Tasks can also have their own sandbox. To specify the directory for tasks to create their sandbox subdirectory in, use - **'--mpi-task-working-dir'** .

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following environment variables will affect the execution of your
**Makeflow**:
### BATCH_OPTIONS

This corresponds to the **-B** <options> parameter and will pass extra
batch options to the underlying execution engine.

### MAKEFLOW_MAX_LOCAL_JOBS
This corresponds to the **-j** <#> parameter and will set the maximum
number of local batch jobs.  If a **-j** <#> parameter is specified, the
minimum of the argument and the environment variable is used.

### MAKEFLOW_MAX_REMOTE_JOBS
This corresponds to the **-J** <#> parameter and will set the maximum
number of local batch jobs.  If a **-J** <#> parameter is specified, the
minimum of the argument and the environment variable is used.

Note that variables defined in your **Makeflow** are exported to the
environment.

### TCP_LOW_PORT
Inclusive low port in range used with **-p 0**.

### TCP_HIGH_PORT)
Inclusive high port in range used with **-p 0**.

## EXIT STATUS
On success, returns zero.  On failure, returns non-zero.

## EXAMPLES

Run makeflow locally with debugging:
```
makeflow -d all Makeflow
```

Run makeflow on Condor will special requirements:
```
makeflow -T condor -B "requirements = MachineGroup == 'ccl'" Makeflow
```

Run makeflow with WorkQueue using named workers:
```
makeflow -T wq -a -N project.name Makeflow
```

Create a directory containing all of the dependencies required to run the
specified makeflow
```
makeflow -b bundle Makeflow
```
