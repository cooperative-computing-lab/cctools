# work_queue_status(1)

## NAME
**work_queue_status** - display status of currently running Work Queue applications.

## SYNOPSIS
**work_queue_status [options] [manager] [port]**

## DESCRIPTION

**work_queue_status** displays the status of currently running Work Queue applications.
When run with no options, it queries the global catalog server to list the currently running
Work Queue managers.  When given an address and a port, it queries a manager directly to obtain
more detailed information about tasks and workers.


- Hostname and port number of the application.
- Number of waiting tasks.
- Number of completed tasks.
- Number of connected workers.
- Number of tasks currently being executed.
- Timestamp of when there was last communication with the application.

## EXAMPLES

Without arguments, **work_queue_status** shows a summary of all of the
projects currently reporting to the default catalog server. Waiting, running,
and complete columns refer to number of tasks:

```
$ work_queue_status
PROJECT            HOST                   PORT WAITING RUNNING COMPLETE WORKERS
shrimp             cclws16.cse.nd.edu     9001     963      37        2      33
crustacea          terra.solar.edu        9000       0    2310    32084     700
```

With the **-R** option, a summary of the resources available to each manager is shown:

```
$ work_queue_status -R
MANAGER                         CORES      MEMORY          DISK
shrimp                         228        279300          932512
crustacea                      4200       4136784         9049985
```

With the **--capacity** option, a summary of the resource capacities for each manager is shown:

```
$ work_queue_status --capacity
MANAGER                         TASKS      CORES      MEMORY          DISK
refine                         ???        ???        ???             ???
shrimp                         99120      99120      781362960       1307691584

```

Use the **-W** option to list the workers connected to a particular manager.
Completed and running columns refer to numbers of tasks:

```
$ work_queue_status -W cclws16.cse.nd.edu 9001
HOST                     ADDRESS          COMPLETED RUNNING
mccourt02.helios.nd.edu  10.176.48.102:40         0 4
cse-ws-23.cse.nd.edu     129.74.155.120:5         0 0
mccourt50.helios.nd.edu  10.176.63.50:560         4 4

```

With the **-T** option, a list of all the tasks submitted to the queue is shown:

```
$ work_queue_status -T cclws16.cse.nd.edu 9001
ID       STATE    PRIORITY HOST                     COMMAND
1000     WAITING         0 ???                      ./rmapper-cs -M fast -M 50bp 1
999      WAITING         0 ???                      ./rmapper-cs -M fast -M 50bp 1
21       running         0 cse-ws-35.cse.nd.edu     ./rmapper-cs -M fast -M 50bp 3
20       running         0 cse-ws-35.cse.nd.edu     ./rmapper-cs -M fast -M 50bp 2
19       running         0 cse-ws-35.cse.nd.edu     ./rmapper-cs -M fast -M 50bp 2
18       running         0 cse-ws-35.cse.nd.edu     ./rmapper-cs -M fast -M 50bp 2
...
```


The **-A** option shows a summary of the resources observed per task
category.

```
$ work_queue_status -A cclws16.cse.nd.edu 9001
CATEGORY        RUNNING    WAITING  FIT-WORKERS  MAX-CORES MAX-MEMORY   MAX-DISK
analysis            216        784           54          4      ~1011      ~3502
merge                20         92           30         ~1      ~4021      21318
default               1         25           54         >1       ~503       >243
```

With the -A option:

- Running and waiting correspond to number of tasks in the category.
- Fit-workers shows the number of connected workers able to run the largest task in the category.
- max-cores, max-memory, and max-disk show the corresponding largest value in the category.


The value may have the following prefixes:

- No prefix. The maximum value was manually specified.
- ~ All the task have run with at most this quantity of resources.
- ï¼ž There is at least one task that has used more than this quantity of resources, but the maximum remains unknown.



Finally, the **-l** option shows statistics of the queue in a JSON object:

```
$ work_queue_status -l cclws16.cse.nd.edu 9001
{"categories":[{"max_disk":"3500","max_memory":"1024","max_cores":"1",...
```

## EXIT STATUS
On success, returns zero.  On failure, returns non-zero.
