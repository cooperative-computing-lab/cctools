# poncho_package_run(1)

## NAME

**poncho_package_run** - wrapper script that executes Python script within an isolated Conda environment

## SYNOPSIS

****poncho_package_run [options] --environment <file> <command and args ...>****

## DESCRIPTION

The **poncho_package_run** tool acts as a wrapper script for a Python task, running the task within the specified Conda environment. **poncho_package_run** can be utilized on different machines within the Work Queue system to unpack and activate a Conda environment, and run a task within the isolated environment.

The --environment <file> argument is the name of the Conda environment as a tarball file in which to run the Python task.
command and args (the COMMAND) are interpreted as ARGV for a command to be run inside the Conda environment.

By default, the conda environment is unpacked into a temporary directory which is removed at the end of execution. If the --unpack-to <dir> is given, then the environment is unpacked to <dir>, and it is not removed at the end of execution. Further (even simultaneous) executions of python_package_run will not unpack the environment if <dir> is already populated. Instances of python_package_run coordinate via a writing lock. By default, the wait for a writing lock is 300 seconds, but this can be modified with the --wait-for-lock <secs> option.

If the argument to --unpack-to does not exist, then it is created as an empty directory. If it is an existing directory, but it is not empty, then unpacking is not performed, regardless on whether this directory contains a valid conda environment.


## OPTIONS 


OPTIONS_ITEM(-e, --environment <file>)   Conda environment as a tar file. (Required.)
OPTIONS_ITEM(-d, --unpack-to <dir>)      Directory to unpack the environment. If not given, a temporary directory is used.
OPTIONS_ITEM(-w, --wait-for-lock <secs>) Number of seconds to wait to get a writing lock on <dir>. Default is 300.
OPTIONS_ITEM(-h, --help)                 Show the help screen.
- **command and args**            Command to execute inside the given environment.

## EXIT STATUS

On success, returns 0. On failure, returns non-zero.

## EXAMPLE

**poncho_package_run --environment example_venv.tar.gz python3 example.py**

This will run the command python3 example.py within the Conda environment in example_venv.tar.gz. Note that this command can be performed either locally, on the same machine that analyzed the script and created the environment, or remotely, on a different machine that contains the Conda environment tarball and the example.py script.

**poncho_package_run --unpack-to my_persistent_env --environment example_venv.tar.gz python3 example.py**

The previous command will run faster the second time it is executed, as the environment is only unpacked once to my_persistent_env.
