SECTION(SYNOPSIS)
CODE(BOLD(resource_monitor_visualizer.py data_path destination_path workflow_name))

SECTION(DESCRIPTION)

BOLD(resource_monitor_visualizer) is a tool to visualize resource usage of the
given workflow. The visualizer creates a series of web pages and graphs to
explore resource usage. Histograms are created for each group and resource.
Currently, groups are determined by command name. Additionally, if time series
data is recorded graphs are created to show the aggregate resource usage over
time.
