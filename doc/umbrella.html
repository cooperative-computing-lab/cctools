			<p>Umbrella is a tool for specifying and materializing
			comprehensive execution environments, from the hardware all the way up to
			software and data.  A user simply invokes Umbrella with the desired task, and
			Umbrella parses the specification,
			determines the minimum mechanism necessary to run the task,
			downloads missing dependencies, and executes the application through the available minimal
			mechanism, which may be direct execution, a system container (Docker, chroot, Parrot), a local
			virtual machine (i.e., VMware), or submission to a cloud environment (i.e.,
			Amazon EC2) or grid environment (i.e., Condor). The following figure shows
			the overview of Umbrella.</p>
            <img class="center" src="images/Umbrella.png" HEIGHT="500" WIDTH="800" align="center"/>

            <p>The architecture of Umbrella is shown in the figure below.</p>

            <img class="center" src="images/umbrella-specification-big-picture.png" HEIGHT="450" WIDTH="600" align="center"/>

			<p>Umbrella contains five parts: user inputs, Umbrella, underlying
			execution engines, remote archive and metadata database. User inputs include
			the specification, the task command, the input files, and the output directory.
			Umbrella connects the user's execution environment specification with the
			underlying execution engines, which includes local resources, clusters, cloud
			resources, and grid resources. The remote archive stores the OS images,
			software dependencies and data dependencies. The metadata database maintains
			the mapping relationship between the dependency name referred in the
			specification and the actual storage location within the remote archive.</p>

			<p>Currently, Umbrella supports three execution engines: local,
			condor, ec2.  Local execution engine can be further devided into three
			categories: parrot, docker, chroot.  Parrot execution engine can be used
			without any special authority on the host machine; Docker execution engine
			requires Docker is installed on the host machine and the user is given the
			right authority to use Docker; chroot execution engine requires the user to be
			the root user.</p>

            <p>To get started using Umbrella, please begin by <a
            href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/manuals/install.html">installing CCTools</a> on your system. When you
            are ready, proceed with the <a href="#have_a_try">Have a Try</a>
            section below. If you are interested in running your CMS applications
			through Umbrella, proceed with the <a href="#try_cms">Try CMS Applications with Umbrella</a>.</p>

			<p>If you want to construct umbrella specification for your own application,
			proceed with the <a href="#create_spec">Create Your Specification</a> section
			below. </p>

			<p>Note: The Docker execution engine  of Umbrella can not work together with AFS.
			If you try to use the Docker execution engine of Umbrella,
			please do not install CCTools on your AFS directory. </p>

				<tt>A.B.C</tt> (A: kernel version; B: major revision of the kernel; C: the
				minor revision of the kernel). You can specify this attribute to a single value
				like <tt>2.6.18</tt> or a range like <tt>&gt;=2.6.18</tt> or a range like
				<tt>[2.6.18, 2.6.32]</tt>.</li>

			</ul>

			<p><b>os</b> Section (required):</p>

			<ul>

				<li><b>name</b> (required): the OS name. Options: redhat, centos, arch, ....
				Not case sensitive.</li>

				<li><b>version</b> (required): the OS version in the format of <tt>A.B</tt>: A
				is the main version number and B is the minor version number. Exmaples: 5.10,
				6.5. </li>

				<li><b>id</b> (optional): the id of the OS image. There may exist multiple OS
				images for redhat 5.10, the id attribute uniquely identifies an OS image. </li>

				<li><b>action</b> (required): the action on the downloaded dependencies.
				Options: <tt>none</tt>, <tt>unpack</tt>. <tt>none</tt> leaves the downloaded
				dedendency as it is. <tt>unpack</tt> uncompresses the dependency. Default: unpack. Not case
				sensitive.</li>

			</ul>

			<p><b>software</b> Section (optional):</p>

			<p>Each software dependency has a case-sensitive name.
			The name of a software dependency is in the format of 'A-B-C-D', where A is
			the software name, B is the software version, C is OS distro name (the OS name followed by
			the main version number, e.g., redhat5), D is

				<p><b>Note:</b> Even if both mountpoint and mount_env are optional, at least one
				of them must be provided.</p>

				<p><b>Relationship between mountpoint and mount_env (3 Cases): </b></p>

				<p> <b>Case 1:</b> If only mountpoint is set to A in a specification, the
				dependency will be downloaded into the umbrella local cache with the file path
				of D, and a new mountpoint will be added into mount_dict (mount_dict[A] = D).
				</p>

				<p> <b>Case 2:</b> If only mount_env is set to B in a specification, the
				dependency will not be downloaded, package_search will be executed to get one
				remote storage location, C, of the dependency, a new environment variable will
				be set (env_para_dict[B] = C).  </p>

				<p> <b>Case 3:</b> If mountpoint is set to A and mount_env is set to B in a
				specification, the dependency will be downloaded into the umbrella local cache
				with the file path of D, and a new mountpoint will be added into mount_dict
				(mount_dict[A] = D) and a new environment variable will also be set
				(env_para_dict[B] = A).  </p>
			</ul>

			<p><b>data</b> Section (optional):</p>

				<li><b>action</b> (required): the action on the downloaded dependencies.
				Options: <tt>none</tt>, <tt>unpack</tt>. <tt>none</tt> leaves the downloaded
				dedendency as it is. <tt>unpack</tt> uncompresses the dependency. Default: unpack. Not case
				sensitive.</li>

				<li><b>mountpoint</b> (optional): the mountpoint of the data dependency. The same as
				the mountpoint attribute of the software section. Case sensitive.</li>

				<li><b>mount_env</b> (optional): the same as the mount_env attribute of the software section. Case sensitive.</li>

				<p><b>Note:</b> Even if both mountpoint and mount_env are optional, at least one
				of them must be provided.</p>
			</ul>

			<p><b>environ</b> Section (optional):</p>

			<p>A list of key-value pairs. For example, <tt>"HOME": "/home/hmeng"</tt>,
			which sets the HOME environment variable used by the sandbox to execute the
			applicition. Case sensitive.</p>

			<p><b>cmd</b> Section (optional):</p>

			<p>The command to execute in the format of a string. </p>

			<p><b>output</b> Section (optional):</p>

			<p>This section allows the creator of an Umbrella spec to specify the output files and directories. Correspondingly,
			there are two subsections: <tt>files</tt> (a list of strings representing the output files) and <tt>dirs</tt> (a list
			of strings representing the output dirs). </p>

			<p><b>Common Attributes of OS, Software, Data Dependencies:</b></p>
			<p>Each OS, software
			and data dependency can have the following attributes: source, checksum, size, format, uncompressed_size.</p>

			<p> These attributes are required in a self-contained umbrella specification,
			but not required in an umbrella specification which is attached to a Metadata
			Database. </p>

			<ul>

				<li><b>source</b>: a list of storage location of the dependency, which includes
				one or more resource URL. Currently Umbrella supports the URLs identifying the resources
				from the following remote services. For private resources from OSF, and S3, the corresponding
				authentication information can be provided through the Umbrella options.</li>

				<hr>
				<table>
				<tr><td><b>remote service</b><td><b>example path</b>
				<tr><td>Local<td>/home/hmeng/data/input
				<tr><td>Hypertext Transfer Protocol<td>http://www.somewhere.com/index.html
				<tr><td>HTTPS<td>https://ccl.cse.nd.edu/index.html
				<tr><td>Amazon S3<td>s3+https://s3.amazonaws.com/testhmeng/4_cubes.pov

				<tr><td><a href="http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem">CernVM File System</a><td>cvmfs://cvmfs/cms.cern.ch
				</table>
				<hr>

				<li><b>checksum</b>: the checksum of the dependencies. Currently Umbrella only
				supports md5 checksum. Not case sensitive.</li>

				<li><b>format</b>: the perservation format of the dependency. Currently
				Umbrella supports two formats: <tt>tgz</tt> (gzip compressed tarball) and
				<tt>plain</tt> (plain text).</li>

				<li><b>size</b>: the size of the dependency in bytes.</li>

				<li><b>uncompressed_size</b>: the uncompressed size of the dependency in bytes, only meaningful
				when the format attribute is not plain text.</li>

			</ul>

			<p><b>Relationship of id and checksum and source.</b> The checksum of each package
			can be used as the id of the package.
			However, it is not necessary for them to be identical to each other. You can
			implement your own mechanism once the id of each
			package is unique for one dependency.
			In case when the checksum of one dependency is not provided or
			feasible, the first item of the source section can be used as the value of the
			id attribute.  For example, in
			the <a href="#try_cms">CMS</a> example, <tt>cmssw-4.2.8-slc5-amd64</tt> is delivered through cvmfs
			during runtime, and no checksum is provided, the url from the source section,
			<tt>cvmfs://cvmfs/cms.cern.ch</tt> is used as the id of this package.

	<h2 id="running">Different Execution Engines of Umbrella<a class="sectionlink" href="#running" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

		<p>At runtime, Umbrella evaluates the local execution environment to see if it
		is compatible with the specification.  Umbrella evaluates the hardware
		resources available, the kernel and OS distribution, and the software and data
		dependencies.  It then selects the mechanism necessary to deliver the desired
		environment.  In the case where Umbrella can not construct the desired
		environment on the local machine, the user will be notified.</p>

		<p><b>Local Cache and Mounting Mechanism.</b> One cache directory will be set
		on each execution node involved in the execution engine to avoid download the
		same data from the remote archive repeatedly.  Umbrella downloads and caches OS
		images, software dependencies, and data dependencies in the host machine, and
		then creates a sandbox to execute the application.  To enable software
		reusability by multiple users, Umbrella constructs the sandbox for each
		application through mounting-based sandbox techniques.</p>

		<p>The following figure shows the relationship between the remote archive, the
		local cache and the sandbox for each application.  <tt>Sandbox 1</tt> uses the
		root filesystem of the host machine as the root filesystem and mounts the
		needed software and data dependencies (<tt>A</tt> and <tt>G</tt>) into it.
		<tt>Sandbox 2</tt> needs to construct a separate root filesystem which groups
		together the needed OS image (<tt>C</tt>), software dependency
		(<tt>A</tt>).</p>

		<img class="center" src="images/umbrella-archive-sandbox-cache.png" HEIGHT="340" WIDTH="510" align="center"/>

			<p>The following parts uses a Ray-Tracing application as an example to illustrate

				the umbrella options. </p>

				<p> Note that the EC2 AMIs, the security groups, key pairs are all regional
				resources ( http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/resources.html
				).  Therefore, please check the region setting of the desired AMI in the
				umbrella spec file, and provide security group, key pairs, ssh keys in the same
				region.  The security group used should allow incoming ssh traffic.  </p>

			<p>The name of an OS image dependency is in the format of 'A-B-C', where A is
			the OS name, B is the OS version, C is hardware architecture.
			<tt>redhat-5.10-x86_64</tt> is an example of this category.</p>

			<p>There is no special limitation on the name of a data dependency.
			<tt>final_events_2381.lhe</tt> is an example of this category.</p>

			<p><b>Multiple Packages for One Dependency.</b> According to the building and
			compilation settings, there may be multiple packages for one dependency. In
			this case, all the packages for one dependency will be organized together and
			the `id` attribute of each package will be used as item key to differentiate
			different packages. For example, for the software dependency
			<tt>povray-3.6.1-redhat5-x86_64</tt>, there are two different packages: one
			with the id of <tt>9b7f2362e6b927c8ef08c3f92599e47c</tt> and one with the id of
			<tt>c9da9e46b3ce0f7f9885ce60077c45c5</tt>.</p>

			<p>Each package may include the following attributes: source, checksum, size, format, and uncompressed_size.</p>

			<p><b>Relationship of id and checksum and source.</b> The checksum of each package
			in the archive can be used as the id of the package in our implementation of metadata database.
			However, it is not necessary for them to be identical to each other. You can
			implement your metadata database in a different semantics once the id of each
			package is unique for one dependency.
			In case when the checksum of one dependency is not provided or
			feasible, the first item of the source section will be used.  For example, in
			the above example, <tt>cmssw-4.2.8-slc5-amd64</tt> is delivered through cvmfs
			during runtime, and no checksum is provided, the url from the source section,
			<tt>cvmfs://cvmfs/cms.cern.ch</tt> is used as the id of this package.
			</p>

			<p><b>Organization of the Local Cache.</b> Within the local cache, the id of
			each package dependency will be used to create a directory under the
			<tt>&lt;localdir&gt;/cache</tt>, then the package will be put into
			<tt>&lt;localdir&gt;/cache/&lt;id<id>gt;/&lt;name&gt;</tt>. Therefore,
			<tt>&lt;localdir&gt;/cache/9b7f2362e6b927c8ef08c3f92599e47c/povray-3.6.1-redhat5-x86_64.tar.gz</tt>
			will be the local location of the first povray package shown in the above
			example. The uncompressed directory of the tarball will be
			<tt>&lt;localdir&gt;/cache/9b7f2362e6b927c8ef08c3f92599e47c/povray-3.6.1-redhat5-x86_64</tt>.</p>

			<p><b>Organization of the Remote Archive.</b> Within the remote archive, to
			differentiate multiple packages for the same dependency and the different
			dependencies, a directory with the name of the checksum of each package will be
			created and functions as the direct parent directory of the package. Therefore,
			in the remote archive, there is a directory named
			<tt>9b7f2362e6b927c8ef08c3f92599e47c</tt>, under which exists
			<tt>povray-3.6.1-redhat5-x86_64.tar.gz</tt> However, the organization of the
			remote archive can be in other format, once you have a way to differentiate the
			packages.</p>

			<p>If you want to customize your own metadata database, please follow the
			requirements above and then tell umbrella through <tt>--meta</tt> option to
			use your own metadata database. For Example:</p>
				<code>umbrella \
	--spec povray.umbrella \
	--meta http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/umbrella/database/packages.json \
	--localdir /tmp/umbrella_test/ \
	--output "/tmp/frame000.png=/tmp/umbrella_test/local_povray" \
	--sandbox_mode local \
	--log umbrella.log \
	run</code>

			<p>There are two ways to create an Umbrella metadata database:
(1) use <b>umbrella --spec spec_filename split new_spec_filename db_filename</b> to abstract all the metadata information from
a self-contained umbrella specification.
(2) Follow the format of the metadata database and create your own metadata database manually.

			<p> As for CMS applications which need software from CVMFS, Umbrella first
			checks whether the execution node has CVMFS installed or not.  If CVMFS is
			installed and its CMS repository is mounted as <tt>/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch</tt>, the
			application can run directly without the help from sandboxing techniques.  If
			CVMFS is not installed or the mountpoint <tt>/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch</tt> is not
			found, <a href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/parrot/">Parrot</a> will be used
			to help access software from CVMFS.  </p>

			<p>Like other software dependencies, the dependency of CMSSW will be specified
			inside the <tt>software</tt> section of the specification, however, you only
			need to specify the <tt>mountpoint</tt> attribute. The <tt>id</tt> and
			<tt>action</tt> attributes for the CMSSW dependency will be ignored even if
			they are specified. In fact, the support for CMS applications are hardcoded
			inside the source code of Umbrella, not inside the metadata database.  </p>

			<p>If you want to run this CMS application through Umbrella, please check the <a href="#try_cms">Try CMS Applications with Umbrella</a>.</p>
