<p>
JX is a superset of JSON with additional syntax for dynamically generating data.
The use case in mind when designing JX was writing job descriptions for a workflow manager accepting JSON input.
For workflows with a large number of rules with similar structure,
it is sometimes necessary to write a script in another language like Python to generate the JSON output.
It would be desirable to have a special-purpose language that can dynamically generate rules while still bearing a resemblance to JSON,
and more importantly, still being readable.
JX is much lighter than a full-featured language like Python or JavaScript,
and is suited to embedding in other systems like a workflow manager.
</p>

<p>
Standard JSON syntax is supported, with some additions from Python.
JX allows for expressions using Python's basic operators.
These include the usual arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators (e.g. <tt>+</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>, <tt>and</tt>, etc.).
JX also includes Python's <tt>range()</tt> function for generating sequences of numbers.
</p>

<pre><code>"123" + 4
=&gt; Error{"source":"jx_eval","name":"mismatched types","message":"mismatched types for operator","operator":"123"+4,"code":2}

"123" + "4"
=&gt; "1234"

123 + 4
=&gt; 127
</code></pre>

Evaluation will produce plain JSON types from JX,
assuming the evaluation succeeded.
If an error occurs, evaluation stops and an error is returned to the caller.
Error objects can include additional information indicating where the failure occurred and what the cause was.
Details on the syntax and usage of Errors is given in a following section.
If a non-error type is returned, then evaluation succeeded and the result contains only plain JSON types.
JX expressions are evaluated in a <em>context</em>,
which is an object mapping names to arbitrary JX values.
On evaluating a variable, the variable's name is looked up in the current context.
If found, the value from the context is substituted in place of the variable.
If the variable is not found in the context, an error is returned.
</p>

<p>JX supports comments, introduced by the <tt>&#35;</tt> character and continuing for the rest of the line.</p>

<p>
For complicated expressions, parentheses may be used as grouping symbols.
JX does not allow tuples.
In the absence of parentheses,
operators are evaluated left to right in order of precedence. From highest to lowest precedence,</p>

<ul>
<li>lookup, function call</li>
<li><tt>*</tt>, <tt>%</tt>, <tt>/</tt></li>
<li><tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt></li>

<p>
Gets the item at the given index/key in a collection type.
A negative index into an array is taken as the offset from the tail end.
</p>

<p>
Arrays also support slicing, with the index is given as <tt>N:M</tt>
where <tt>N</tt> and <tt>M</tt> are optional values that evaluate to integers.
If either is absent, the beginning/end of the array is used.
This slice syntax is based on Python's.

<pre><code>range(10)
= [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

range(10)[:3]
= [0, 1, 2]

<h2 id="functions">Functions<a class="sectionlink" href="#functions" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>range(A) -&gt; Array
range(A, A[, A]) -&gt; Array
</code></pre>

<p>where A = Integer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Returns an array of integers ranging over the given values. This function is a reimplementation of <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range">Python's range function</a>. range has two forms,</p>

<pre><code>range(stop)
range(start, stop[, step])
</code></pre>

<p>The first form returns an array of integers from zero to stop (exclusive).</p>

<pre><code>range(10)
=&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
</code></pre>

<p>The second form returns an array of integers ranging from start (inclusive) to stop (exclusive).</p>

<pre><code>range(3, 7)
=&gt; [3, 4, 5, 6]

range(7, 3)
=&gt; []
</code></pre>

<p>The second form also allows an optional third parameter, step. If not given, step defaults to one.</p>

<pre><code>range(-1, 10, 2)
=&gt; [-1,1,3,5,7,9]

range(5,0,-1)
=&gt; [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>Calling with step = 0 is an error.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>format(A, ...) -&gt; String
</code></pre>

<p>where A = String</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Replaces format specifiers in the given string.
This function is based on C's <tt>printf</tt> function and provides the following format specifiers.
<ul>
	<li><tt>&#37;d</tt></li>
	<li><tt>&#37;i</tt></li>
	<li><tt>&#37;e</tt></li>
	<li><tt>&#37;E</tt></li>
	<li><tt>&#37;f</tt></li>
	<li><tt>&#37;F</tt></li>
	<li><tt>&#37;g</tt></li>
	<li><tt>&#37;G</tt></li>
	<li><tt>&#37;s</tt></li>
	<li><tt>&#37;&#37;</tt></li>
</ul>
</p>

<pre><code>format("file%d.txt", 10)
= "file10.txt"

format("SM%s_%d.sam", "10001", 23)
= "SM10001_23.sam"
</code></pre>

<p>
This function serves the same purpose as Python's format operator (&#37;).
Since JX does not include tuples,
it provides a function to allow formatting with multiple fields.
JX's format function could be written in Python as follows.

<pre><code>def format(spec, *args):
    return spec % tuple(args)
</code></pre>
</p>

<h2 id="comprehensions">Comprehensions<a class="sectionlink" href="#comprehensions" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>
JX supports list comprehensions for expressing repeated structure.
An entry in a list can be postfixed with one or more <tt>for</tt> clauses to evaluate the list item once for each entry in the specified list.
A <tt>for</tt> clause consists of a variable and a list, along with an optional condition.

<pre><code>[x + x for x in ["a", "b", "c"]]
= ["aa", "bb", "cc"]

[3 * i for i in range(4)]
= [0, 3, 6, 9]

[i for i in range(10) if i%2 == 0]
= [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
</code></pre>

If multiple clauses are specified,
they are evaluated from left to right.

<pre><code>[[i, j] for i in range(5) for j in range(4) if (i + j)%2 == 0]
= [[0, 0], [0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0], [2, 2], [3, 1]]
</code></pre>
</p>

<h2 id="errors">Errors<a class="sectionlink" href="#errors" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>
JX has a special type, Error, to indicate some kind of failure or exceptional condition.
If a function or operator is misapplied,
jx_eval will return an error indicating the cause of the failure.
Errors are akin to Python's exceptions,
but JX does not allow Errors to be caught;
they simply terminate evaluation and report what happened.
Errors do not evaluate in the same way as other types.
The additional information in an error is protected from evaluation,
so calling jx_eval on an Error simply returns a copy.
It is therefore safe to directly include the invalid function/operator in the body of an error.
If a function or operator encounters an error as an argument,
evaluation is aborted and the Error is returned as the result of evaluation.
Thus if an error occurs deeply nested within a structure,
the error will be passed up as the result of the entire evaluation.
Errors are defined using the keyword Error followed by a body enclosed in curly braces.
</p>

<pre><code>Error{"source":"jx_eval","name":"undefined symbol","message":"undefined symbol","context":{"outfile":"results","infile":"mydata","a":true,"b":false,"f":0.5,"g":3.14159,"x":10,"y":20,"list":[100,200,300],"object":{"house":"home"}},"symbol":c,"code":0}
</code></pre>

<p>All errors <em>MUST</em> include some special keys with string values.</p>

<ul>
<li>"source": indicates where the error comes from, and the structure of the additional data.</li>
<li>"name": the general category of the error, e.g. "syntax error" or "timed out"</li>
<li>"message": some human-readable details about the conditions of the error.</li>
</ul>

<p>Errors from "jx_eval" have some additional keys, described below, to aid in debugging. Other sources are free to use any structure for their additional error data.</p>

<h3 id="jx_errors">JX Errors<a class="sectionlink" href="#jx_errors" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

<p>Errors produced during evaluation of a JX structure all include some common keys.</p>

<ul>
<li>"source": "jx_eval"</li>
<li>"code": A numeric identifier for the type of error.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following codes and names are used by jx_eval.</p>

<ul>
<li>0: "undefined symbol"
The given symbol was not present in the evaluation context. This error includes two additional keys:
<ul><li>"symbol": the symbol name being looked up</li>
<li>"context": the evaluation context</li></ul></li>
<li>1: "unsupported operator"
The operator cannot be applied to the type given. This error also includes an "operator" key containing the operator that caused the error, as well as its operands.</li>
<li>2: "mismatched types"
The binary operator can only be applied to operands of the same type. This error also includes an "operator" key containing the operator that caused the error, as well as its operands.</li>
<li>3: "key not found"
Object lookup failed because the given object does not contain the requested key. This error also includes two additional keys:
<ul><li>"key"</li>
<li>"object"</li></ul></li>
<li>4: "range error"
Array lookup failed because the requested index is outside the given array's bounds. This error also includes two additional keys:
<ul><li>"index"</li>
<li>"array"</li></ul></li>
<li>5: "arithmetic error"
The the operands are outside the given arithmetic operator's range. This error also includes an "operator" key containing the operator that caused the error, as well as its operands.</li>
<li>6: "invalid arguments"
The function arguments are not valid for the given function. This error also includes a "function" key containing the function that caused the error, as well as its arguments.</li>
</ul>
