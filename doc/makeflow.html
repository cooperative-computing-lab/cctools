<h2 id="overview">Overview<a class="sectionlink" href="#overview" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>Makeflow is a <b>workflow engine</b> for large scale distributed computing.
It accepts a specification of a large amount of work to be performed,
and runs it on
remote machines in parallel where possible.  In addition, Makeflow is
fault-tolerant, so you can use it to coordinate very large tasks that may run
for days or weeks in the face of failures.  Makeflow is designed to be similar
to <b>Make</b>, so if you can write a Makefile, then you can write a
Makeflow.</p>

<p>Makeflow makes it easy to move a large amount of work from one facility to another.  After writing a workflow, you can test it out on your local laptop,
then run it at your university computing center, move it over to a national
computing facility like <a href=http://www.xsede.org>XSEDE</a>, and
then again to a commercial cloud system.  Tasks can also be run using
Docker containers.  Using the (bundled) Work Queue system, you can
even run across multiple systems simultaneously.  No matter where you run your tasks, the workflow language stays the same.</p>

<p>Makeflow is used in production to support large scale problems
in science and engineering.  Researchers in fields such as bioinformatics,
biometrics, geography, and high energy physics all use Makeflow to compose
workflows from existing applications.</p>

<p>Makeflow currently supports these batch systems:
<table>
<tr><td>local    <td> Local execution on the submitting machine, using multiple cores if available.
<tr><td>wq       <td> <a href=http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/workqueue>Work Queue</a> distributed application system, included with Makeflow.

<p> Makeflow is part of the <a
href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software">Cooperating Computing Tools</a>.  You can
download the CCTools from <a

<h2 id="language">The Makeflow Language<a class="sectionlink" href="#language" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>The Makeflow language is very similar to Make.  A Makeflow script consists
of a set of rules.  Each rule specifies a set of <i>target files</i> to create,
a set of <i>source files</i> needed to create them, and a <i>command</i> that
generates the target files from the source files.</p>

<p>Makeflow attempts to generate all of the target files in a script.  It
examines all of the rules and determines which rules must run before others.
Where possible, it runs commands in parallel to reduce the execution time.</p>

<p>Here is a Makeflow that uses the <tt>convert</tt> utility to make an
animation.  It downloads an image from the web, creates four variations of the
image, and then combines them back together into an animation.  The first and
the last task are marked as LOCAL to force them to run on the controlling
machine.</p>

<code>CURL=/usr/bin/curl
CONVERT=/usr/bin/convert

</code>

<p>Note that Makeflow differs from Make in a few important ways.
The <a href=#details>complete details</a> are given below.</p>

<h2 id="running">Running Makeflow<a class="sectionlink" href="#running" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>To try out the example above, copy and paste it into a file named
<tt>example.makeflow</tt>.  To run it on your local machine:</p>

<code>makeflow example.makeflow</code>

<p>Note that if you run it a second time, nothing will happen, because all of
the files are built:</p>

<code>makeflow example.makeflow
makeflow: nothing left to do
</code>

<p>Use the <tt>-c</tt> option to clean everything up before trying it
again:</p>

<code>makeflow -c example.makeflow</code>

<p>If you have access to a batch system like Condor, SGE, Torque, SLURM, or Moab,
you can direct Makeflow to run your jobs there:</p>

<code>
makeflow -T condor example.makeflow

makeflow -T sge example.makeflow

makeflow -T torque example.makeflow
...
</code>

<h2 id="workqueue">Running Makeflow with Work Queue<a class="sectionlink" href="#workqueue" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>You will notice that a workflow can run very slowly if you submit each task
in the usual way, because it typically takes 30 seconds or so to start each
batch job running.  To get around this limitation, we provide the Work Queue
system.  This allows Makeflow to function as a master process that quickly
dispatches work to remote worker processes.</p>

<p>To begin, let's assume that you are logged into a machine named
<tt>barney.nd.edu</tt>. start your Makeflow like this:</p>

<code>makeflow -T wq example.makeflow</code>

<p>Then, submit 10 worker processes to Condor like this:</p>

<code>condor_submit_workers barney.nd.edu 9123 10
Submitting job(s)..........
Logging submit event(s)..........
10 job(s) submitted to cluster 298.
</code>

<p>Or, submit 10 worker processes to SGE like this:</p>

<code>sge_submit_workers barney.nd.edu 9123 10</code>

<p>Or, you can start workers manually on any other machine you can log into:</p>

<code>work_queue_worker barney.nd.edu 9123</code>

<p>Once the workers begin running, Makeflow will dispatch multiple tasks to
each one very quickly.  If a worker should fail, Makeflow will retry the work
elsewhere, so it is safe to submit many workers to an unreliable system.</p>

<p>When the Makeflow completes, your workers will still be available, so you
can either run another Makeflow with the same workers, remove them from the
batch system, or wait for them to expire.  If you do nothing for 15 minutes,
they will automatically exit.</p>

<p>Note that <tt>condor_submit_workers</tt> and <tt>sge_submit_workers</tt>,
are simple shell scripts, so you can edit them directly if you would like to
change batch options or other details. Please refer to <a href="workqueue.html"</a> Work Queue manual </a> for more details.

<h3 id="workqueue.port">Port Numbers<a class="sectionlink" href="#workqueue.port" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

<p>Makeflow listens on a port which the remote workers would connect to.  The
default port number is 9123.  Sometimes, however, the port number might be not
available on your system. You can change the default port via the <tt>-p</tt> option. For example, if you want the master to listen
on port 9567 by default, you can run the following command:</p>

<code>makeflow -T wq -p 9567 example.makeflow</code>

<h3 id="workqueue.projectnames">Project Names<a class="sectionlink" href="#workqueue.projectnames" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

<p>The best and simplest way to match workers to masters is to use the project name
matching. You can give the master a project name with the -N option. This works with any batch system type used.</p>

<code>makeflow -T wq -N MyProj example.makeflow </code>

<p>The -N option gives the master a project name called 'MyProj',
and will cause it to advertise its information
such as the project name, running status, hostname and port number, to a catalog server.
Then a worker can simply identify the workload by its project name.
By default, makeflow will use the global catalog server at <a href=http://catalog.cse.nd.edu>catalog.cse.nd.edu</a>
but this can be changed, as described below.
</p>

<p>To start a worker that automatically finds MyProj's master via the default
Notre Dame catalog server:</p>

<code>work_queue_worker -N MyProj </code>

<p>You can also give multiple -N options to a worker. The worker will find out
which ones of the specified projects are running from the catalog server and
randomly select one to work for. When one project is done, the worker would
repeat this process.  Thus, the worker can work for a different master without
being stopped and given the different master's hostname and port. An example of
specifying multiple projects:</p>

<code>work_queue_worker -N proj1 -N proj2 -N proj3</code>

<p>
In addition to creating a project name using the -N option, this will also trigger automatic reporting to the 
designated catalog server. The Port and Server address are taken from the environment variables <b>CATALOG_HOST</b> 
and <b>CATALOG_PORT</b>. If either variable is not set, then the addresses "catalog.cse.nd.edu,backup-catalog.cse.nd.edu" and port 9097 will be used.
</p>

<h3 id="workqueue.password">Setting a Password<a class="sectionlink" href="#workqueue.password" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

<p>We recommend that any workflow that uses a project name also set a password.
To do this, select any password and write it to a file called
<tt>mypwfile</tt>.  Then, run Makeflow and each worker with the
<tt>--password</tt> option to indicate the password file:</p>

<code>makeflow <b>--password</b> mypwfile ...
work_queue_worker <b>--password</b> mypwfile ...
</code>

<h3 id="workqueue.catalog">Catalog Server<a class="sectionlink" href="#workqueue.catalog" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

<p>It is also possible to run your own catalog server. See <a href="catalog.html">Catalog Servers</a> for details.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a catalog server listening at catalog.somewhere.edu:9097. To
make your masters and workers contact this catalog server, simply add the
<tt>-C hostname:port</tt> option to both of your master and worker:</p>

<code>makeflow -T wq -C catalog.somewhere.edu:9097 -N MyProj example.makeflow
work_queue_worker -C catalog.somewhere.edu:9097 -a -N MyProj
</code>

<h2 id="docker">Running Makeflow with Docker<a class="sectionlink" href="#docker" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>Makeflow can be used with Docker to create a precise execution environment for each task.  In this mode, Makeflow will
invoke Docker to set up the environment, copy the input files into the container, run the command, and then save the
output files created by the command.</p>

<p>To do this, simply invoke Makeflow with the <tt>--docker</tt> argument, and name the container image
that you wish all of the commands to use.  Makeflow will ensure that the named image is pulled into each
Docker node, and then execute the task within that container.  For example, <tt>--docker debian</tt>
will cause all tasks to be run in the container name <tt>debian</tt>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you have an exported container image, you can use the exported image via the <tt>--docker-tar</tt> option.
Makeflow will load the container into each execution node as needed.  This allows you to use a container without pushing it to a remote repository.
</p>

<p>This capability <i>in addition</i> to the selection of a batch system.  For example, if you invoke
<tt>makeflow -T condor --docker debian</tt>, then Makeflow will distribute tasks via Condor, and
then use Docker to invoke the task at each execution node.

<h2 id="singularity">Running Makeflow with Singularity<a class="sectionlink" href="#docker" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>In Addition to Docker, Makeflow can also be used with Singularity to containerize work into a custom execution environment. 
When using this mode, Singularity will take in an image, set up the container, and runs the command inside of the container.
Any needed input files will be read in from Makeflow, and created files will be delivered by Makeflow.</p>

<p> To use this mode, invoke Makeflow with the <tt>--singularity=&lt;img&gt;</tt> argument. Makeflow will ensure that the passed image
will be sent to each worker. All of the comands will be ran through the container built with that image. Unlike Docker, Singularity 
requires that users provide their own image.</p>

<p>Similarly, this capability can be used <i>in addition</i> to the selection of a batch system. Thus, if you launch Makeflow as
<tt>makeflow -T condor --singularity=mycontainer.img</tt>, then Makeflow will distribute tasks via Condor, and
then use Singularity to execute the task at each worker.


<h2 id="umbrella">Running Makeflow with Umbrella<a class="sectionlink" href="#umbrella" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>Makeflow allows the user to specify the execution environment for each rule
via its <tt>--umbrella-spec</tt> and <tt>--umbrella-binary</tt> options.  The
<tt>--umbrella-spec</tt> option allows the user to specify an Umbrella
specification, the <tt>--umbrella-binary</tt> option allows the user to specify
the path to an Umbrella binary.  Using this mode, each rule will be converted
into an Umbrella job, and the specified Umbrella specification and binary will
be added into the input file list of a job.  </p>

To test makeflow with umbrella using local execution engine:
<code>makeflow --umbrella-binary $(which umbrella) --umbrella-spec convert_S.umbrella example.makeflow
</code>

To test makeflow with umbrella using wq execution engine:
<code>makeflow -T wq --umbrella-binary $(which umbrella) --umbrella-spec convert_S.umbrella example.makeflow
</code>

<p> To run each makeflow rule as an Umbrella job, the <tt>--umbrella-spec</tt>
must be specified.  However, the <tt>--umbrella-binary</tt> option is optional:
when it is specified, the specified umbrella binary will be sent to the
execution node; when it is not specified, the execution node is expected to
have an umbrella binary available through the <tt>$PATH</tt> environment
variable. </p>

<p> Makeflow also allows the user to specify the umbrella log file prefix via
its <tt>--umbrella-log-prefix</tt> option. The umbrella log file is in the
format of "<umbrella-log-prefix>.<rule_id>". The default value for the
<tt>--umbrella-log-prefix</tt> option is "<makefile_path>.umbrella.log". </p>

<p> Makeflow also allows the user to specify the umbrella execution mode via
its <tt>--umbrella-mode</tt> option. Currently, this option can be set to the
following three modes: local, parrot, and docker. The default value of the
<tt>--umbrella-mode</tt> option is local, which first tries to utilize the
docker mode, and tries to utilize the parrot mode if the docker mode is not
available. </p>

<h2 id="details">More Language Details<a class="sectionlink" href="#details" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>The Makeflow language is very similar to Make, but it does have a few important differences that you should be aware of.</p>

<h3 id="details.dependencies">Get the Dependencies Right<a class="sectionlink" href="#details.dependencies" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

<p>You must be careful to accurately specify <b>all of the files that a rule
requires and creates</b>, including any custom executables.  This is because
Makeflow requires all these information to construct the environment for a
remote job.  For example, suppose that you have written a simulation program
called <tt>mysim.exe</tt> that reads <tt>calib.data</tt> and then produces and
output file.  The following rule won't work, because it doesn't inform Makeflow
what files are neded to execute the simulation:</p>

<code># This is an incorrect rule.

output.txt:
        ./mysim.exe -c calib.data -o output.txt
</code>

<p>However, the following is correct, because the rule states all of the files
needed to run the simulation.  Makeflow will use this information to construct
a batch job that consists of <tt>mysim.exe</tt> and <tt>calib.data</tt> and
uses it to produce <tt>output.txt</tt>:</p>

<code># This is a correct rule.

output.txt: mysim.exe calib.data
        ./mysim.exe -c calib.data -o output.txt
</code>

<p>Note that when a directory is specified as an input dependency, it
means that the command relies on the directory and all of its contents.
So, if you have a large collection of input data, you can place it
in a single directory, and then simply give the name of that directory.
</p>

<h3 id="details.phony">No Phony Rules<a class="sectionlink" href="#details.phony" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

<p>For a similar reason, you cannot have "phony" rules that don't actually
create the specified files.  For example, it is common practice to define a
<tt>clean</tt> rule in Make that deletes all derived files.  This doesn't make
sense in Makeflow, because such a rule does not actually create a file named
<tt>clean</tt>.  Instead use the <tt>-c</tt> option as shown above.</p>

<h3 id="details.plain">Just Plain Rules<a class="sectionlink" href="#details.plain" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

<p>Makeflow does not support all of the syntax that you find in various
versions of Make.  Each rule must have exactly one command to execute.  If you
have multiple commands, simply join them together with semicolons.  Makeflow
allows you to define and use variables, but it does not support  pattern rules,
wildcards, or special variables like <tt>$&lt;</tt> or <tt>$@</tt>.  You simply
have to write out the rules longhand, or write a script in your favorite
language to generate a large Makeflow.</p>

<h3 id="details.local">Local Job Execution<a class="sectionlink" href="#details.local" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

<p>Certain jobs don't make much sense to distribute.  For example, if you have
a very fast running job that consumes a large amount of data, then it should
simply run on the same machine as Makeflow.  To force this, simply add the word
<tt>LOCAL</tt> to the beginning of the command line in the rule.</p>

<h3 id="details.scope">Rule Lexical Scope<a class="sectionlink" href="#details.scope" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

<p>Variables in Makeflow have global scope, that is, once defined, their value
can be accessed from any rule. Sometimes it is useful to define a variable
locally inside a rule, without affecting the global value. In Makeflow, this
can be achieved by defining the variables after the rule's requirements, but
before the rule's command, and prepending the name of the variable with
<tt>@</tt>, as follows:</p>

<code>SOME_VARIABLE=original_value

target_1: source_1
	command_1

target_2: source_2
@SOME_VARIABLE=local_value_for_2
	command_2

target_3: source_3
	command_3 </code>

In this example, SOME_VARIABLE has the value 'original_value' for rules 1 and
3, and the value 'local_value_for_2' for rule 2.

<h3 id="details.environment">Environment Variables<a class="sectionlink" href="#details.environment" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

Environment variables can be defined with the <tt>export</tt> keyword inside a workflow.  Makeflow will communicate explicitly named environment variables
to remote batch systems, where they will override whatever local setting is present.  For example, suppose you want to modify the PATH for every job in the makeflow:

<code>export PATH=/opt/tools/bin:${PATH}</code>

If no value is given, then the current value of the environment variable is passed along to the job:

<code>export USER</code>

<h3 id="details.refinement">Batch Job Refinement<a class="sectionlink" href="#details.refinement" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

<p>When executing jobs, Makeflow simply uses the default settings in your batch
system.  If you need to pass additional options, use the <tt>BATCH_OPTIONS</tt>
variable or the <tt>-B</tt> option to Makeflow.</p>

<p>When using Condor, this string will be added to each submit file.  For
example, if you want to add <tt>Requirements</tt> and <tt>Rank</tt> lines to
your Condor submit files, add this to your Makeflow:</p>

<code>BATCH_OPTIONS = Requirements = (Memory&gt;1024)</code>
<p>
When using SGE, the string will be added to the qsub options.  For example, to specify that jobs should be submitted to the <tt>devel</tt> queue:
<code>BATCH_OPTIONS = -q devel</code>

<h3 id="details.renaming">Remote File Renaming<a class="sectionlink" href="#details.renaming" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

<p>With the Work Queue and Condor batch systems, Makeflow has a feature called
remote file renaming. For example:</p>

<code>local_name-&gt;remote_name</code>

<p>indicates that the file <tt>local_name</tt> is called <tt>remote_name</tt>
in the remote system. Consider the following example:</p>

<code>b.out: a.in myprog
LOCAL myprog a.in &gt; b.out

c.out-&gt;out: a.in-&gt;in1 b.out myprog-&gt;prog
        prog in1 b.out &gt; out
</code>

<p>The first rule runs locally, using the executable <tt>myprog</tt> and the
local file <tt>a.in</tt> to locally create <tt>b.out</tt>.  The second rule
runs remotely, but the remote system expects <tt>a.in</tt> to be named
<tt>in1</tt>, <tt>c.out</tt>, to be named <tt>out</tt> and so on. Note that we
did not need to rename the file <tt>b.out</tt>. Without remote file renaming,
we would have to create either a symbolic link, or a copy of the files with the
expected correct names.</p>

<h3 id="details.renaming">Nested Makeflows<a class="sectionlink" href="#details.nested" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h3>

One Makeflow can be nested inside of another by writing a rule
with the following syntax:

<code>output-files: input-files
    MAKEFLOW makeflow-file [working-dir]
</code>

The input and output files are specified as usual, describing the files
consumed and created by the child makeflow as a whole.  Then, the <tt>MAKEFLOW</tt> keyword< introduces the child makeflow specification, and an
optional working directory into which the makeflow will be executed.
If not given, the current working directory is assumed.

<h2 id="details.displaying">Displaying a Makeflow<a class="sectionlink" href="#details.displaying" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>There are several ways to visualize both the structure of a Makeflow
as well as its progress over time.
<tt>makeflow_viz</tt> can be used to convert a Makeflow into
a file that can be displayed by <a href="http://www.graphviz.org">Graphviz DOT</a> tools like this:</p>

<code>makeflow_viz -D dot example.makeflow &gt; example.dot<br>
dot -Tgif &lt; example.dot &gt; example.gif
</code>
<p>
Or use a similar command to generate a <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org">Cytoscape</a> input file.  (This will also create a Cytoscape <tt>style.xml</tt> file.)</p>

<code>makeflow_viz -D cyto example.makeflow > example.xgmml</code>

<p>To observe how a makeflow runs over time, use <tt>makeflow_graph_log</tt> to convert a log file into a timeline that shows the number of tasks ready, running, and complete over time:</p>

<code>makeflow_graph_log example.makeflowlog example.png</code>

<h2 id="wrappers">Wrapper Commands<a class="sectionlink" href="#wrappers" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>
Makeflow allows a global wrapper command to be applied to every rule in the workflow.  This is particularly useful for applying troubleshooting tools, or for setting up a global environment without rewriting the entire workflow.  The <tt>--wrapper</tt> option will prefix a command in front of every rule, while the <tt>--wrapper-input</tt> and <tt>--wrapper-output</tt> options will specify input and output files related to the wrapper.</p>

<p>A few special characters are supported by wrappers.  If the wrapper command or wrapper files contain two percents (<tt>%%</tt>), then the number of the current rule will be substituted there.  If the command contains curly braces (<tt>{}</tt>) the original command will be substituted at that point.
Square brackets (<tt>[]</tt>) are the same as curly braces, except that the command is quoted and escaped before substitution.
If neither specifier is given, Makeflow appends <tt>/bin/sh -c []</tt> to the wrapper command.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that you wish to shell builtin command <tt>time</tt> to
every rule in the workflow.  Instead of modifying the workflow, run it like
this:</p>

<code>makeflow --wrapper 'time -p' example.makeflow</code>

<p>Since the preceding wrapper did not specify where to substitute the command, it is equivalent to</p>
<code>makeflow --wrapper 'time -p /bin/sh -c []' example.makeflow</code>
<p>This way, if a single rule specifies multiple commands, the wrapper will time <em>all</em> of them.</p>

<p>The square brackets and the default
behavior of running commands in a shell were added because Makeflow allows a rule to run multiple commands. The curly braces simply perform text substitution, so for example</p>
<code>makeflow --wrapper 'env -i {}' example.makeflow</code>
does not work correctly if multiple commands are specified.
<code>target_1: source_1
	command_1; command_2; command_3</code>
will be executed as
<code>env -i command_1; command_2; command_3</code>
<p>Notice that only <tt>command_1</tt>'s environment will be cleared; subsequent commands are not affected.
Thus this wrapper should be given as</p>
<code>makeflow --wrapper 'env -i /bin/sh -c []' example.makeflow</code>
or more succinctly as
<code>makeflow --wrapper 'env -i' example.makeflow</code>

<p>Suppose you want to apply <tt>strace</tt> to every rule, to obtain system call traces.  Since every rule would have to have its own output file for the trace, you could indicate output files like this:</p>

<code>makeflow --wrapper 'strace -o trace.%%' --wrapper-output 'trace.%%' example.makeflow</code>

<p>Suppose you want to wrap every command with a script that would set up an appropriate Java environment.  You might write a script called <tt>setupjava.sh</tt> like this:</p>

<code>#!/bin/sh<br>
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/java-9.8.3.6.7<br>
export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:$PATH<br>
echo "using java in $JAVA_HOME"<br>
exec "$@"<br>
</code>

<p>And then invoke Makeflow like this:</p>

<code>makeflow --wrapper ./setupjava.sh --wrapper-input setupjava.sh example.makeflow</code>


<h2 id="resources">Resources and Categories<a class="sectionlink" href="#resources" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>
Makeflow has the capability of automatically setting the cores, memory,
and disk space requirements to the underlying batch system (currently this only
works with Work Queue and Condor). Jobs are grouped into <em> job categories
</em>, and jobs in the same category have the same cores, memory, and disk
requirements.
</p>
<p>
Job categories and resources are specified with variables.  Jobs are assigned
to the category named in the value of the variable CATEGORY.  Likewise, the
values of the variables CORES, MEMORY (in MB), and DISK (in MB) describe the
resources requirements for the category specified in CATEGORY.
</p>
<p>
Jobs without an explicit category are assigned to <tt>default</tt>.  Jobs in
the default category get their resource requirements from the value of the
environment variables CORES, MEMORY, and DISK.
</p>

Consider the following example:

<code> # These tasks are assigned to the category preprocessing.
# MEMORY and CORES are read from the environment, if defined.

CATEGORY="preprocessing"
DISK=500

one: src
    cmd

two: src
    cmd

# These tasks have the category "simulation". Note that now CORES, MEMORY, and DISK are specified.

CATEGORY="simulation"
CORES=1
MEMORY=400
DISK=400

three: src
    cmd

four: src
    cmd

# Another category switch. MEMORY is read from the environment.

CATEGORY="analysis"
CORES=4
DISK=600

five: src
    cmd
</code>

<code>export MEMORY=800
makeflow ...
</code>

<h2 id="linking">Mountfile Support<a class="sectionlink" href="#mountfile" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p><tt>Makeflow</tt> allows the user to specify the source and target of each input dependency for a makeflow through
<tt>--mounts mountfile</tt> option. Every line of <tt>mountfile</tt> should be in the format of <tt>target source</tt>. </p>

<p>Here is an example of a mountfile:</p>
<code>curl /usr/bin/curl
convert ../bin/convert
data/file1 /home/bob/input1
1.root http://myresearch.org/1.root
</code>

<p>To limit the behavoir of a makeflow inside the current working directory, the <tt>target</tt> field should satisfy the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the target path should not exist;</li>
  <li>the target path should be relative;</li>
  <li>the target path should not include any symbolic links; (For example,
  if the target path is <tt>a/b/c/d</tt>, then <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>,
  <tt>c</tt> should not be symbolic links.) This avoids the makeflow
  leaving the current working directory through symbolic links.</li>
  <li>the target path should not include doubledots (<tt>..</tt>) to limit
  makeflow to the current working directory.  For example, <tt>a/../b</tt>
  is an invalid target, however, <tt>a/b..c/d</tt> is a valid target. </li>
  <li>the target path should be the same with its usage in Makeflow makefiles.
  For example, the target path for the path <tt>./mycurl</tt> from a makefile
  must also be <tt>./mycurl</tt>, can not be <tt>mycurl</tt>.
</ul>

<p>The <tt>source</tt> field can be a local file path or a http URL. When a local file path is specified,
the following requirements should be satisfied:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the source path should exist;</li>
  <li>the source path can be relative or absolute;</li>
  <li>the source path can include doubledots (<tt>..</tt>);</li>
  <li>the source path should only be regular files, directories, and symbolic links;</li>
  <li>the source path should not be any ancestor directory of the target to avoid infinite loop;</li>
</ul>

<p>To execute a makeflow with a mountfile, named <tt>mountfile</tt>, specifying its input dependencies:</p>

<code>makeflow --mounts mountfile example.makeflow</code>

<p>Before execution, Makeflow first parses each line of the mountfile when the <tt>--mounts</tt> option is set, and copies the specified dependency from the location specified by <tt>source</tt> field into a local cache, and then links the <tt>target</tt> to the item under the cache. Makeflow also records the location of the local cache and the info (source, target, filename under the cache dir, and so on) of each dependencies specified in the mountfile into its log.</p>

<p>To cleanup a makeflow together with the local cache and all the links created due to the mountfile:</p>
<code>makeflow -c example.makeflow</code>

<p>To only cleanup the local cache and all the links created due to the mountfile:</p>
<code>makeflow -ccache example.makeflow</code>

<p>By default, makeflow would create a unique directory under the current working directory to hold all the dependencies introduced by the mountfile.
However, Makeflow also allows the user to provide a cache dir through the <tt>--cache cache_dir</tt> option, which can be empty or already has some of the depedencies, or all the dependencies.</p>

<p>To limit the behavoir of a makeflow inside the current working directory, the <tt>cache_dir</tt> should satisfy the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the cache_dir path should be a relative path;</li>
  <li>the cache_dir path should not include any symbolic link; (For example,
  if the cache_dir path is <tt>a/b/c/d</tt>, then <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>,
  <tt>c</tt> should not be symbolic link.) This limitation aims to avoid the makeflow
  leaving the current working directory through symbolic links.</li>
  <li>the cache_dir path should not include doubledots (<tt>..</tt>) to limit the
  behavoir of the makeflow within the current working directory.  For example, <tt>a/../b</tt>
  is an invalid cache_dir, however, <tt>a/b..c/d</tt> is a valid cache_dir. </li> </ul>
</ul>

<p>To execute a makeflow with a mountfile, named <tt>mountfile</tt>, specifying its input dependencies, and a given cache, named <tt>mycache</tt>, specifying the cache location:</p>

<code>makeflow --mounts mountfile --cache mycache example.makeflow</code>

<p>Makeflow first checks the validity of the specified cache path, and then creates it if necessary. Then all the missing dependencies will be copied
from the source to the cache dir, and the link from each dependency to its target under the cache dir will be created. The other part of Makeflow works
similarly to the case when there is no <tt>--cache</tt> option.</p>

<h2 id="linking">Linking Dependencies<a class="sectionlink" href="#linking" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p><tt>Makeflow</tt> provides a tool to collect all of the dependencies for a
given workflow into one directory. By collecting all of the input files and
programs contained in a workflow it is possible to run the workflow on other
machines.</p>

<p>Currently, <tt>Makeflow</tt> copies all of the files specified as
dependencies by the rules in the makeflow file, including scripts and data
files. Some of the files not collected are dynamically linked libraries,
executables not listed as dependencies (<tt>python</tt>, <tt>perl</tt>), and
configuration files (<tt>mail.rc</tt>).</p>

<p>To avoid naming conflicts, files which would otherwise have an identical
path are renamed when copied into the bundle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All file paths are relative to the top level directory.</li>
  <li>The makeflow file is rewritten with the new file locations and placed in the top level directory.</li>
  <li>Files originally specified with an absolute path are placed into the top level directory.</li>
  <li>Files with the same path are appended with a unique number</li>
</ul>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<code>makeflow_analyze -b some_output_directory example.makeflow</code>

<h2 id="garbage">Garbage Collection<a class="sectionlink" href="#garbage" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>As the workflow execution progresses, Makeflow can automatically delete
intermediate files that are no longer needed. In this context, an intermediate
file is an input of some rule that is the target of another rule. Therefore, by
default, garbage collection does not delete the original input files, nor <b>
final</b> target files.</p>

<p>Which files are deleted can be tailored from the default by appending files
to the Makeflow variables <tt>MAKEFLOW_INPUTS</tt> and <tt>MAKEFLOW_OUTPUTS</tt>.
Files added to <tt>MAKEFLOW_INPUTS</tt> augment the original inputs files that
should not be deleted. <tt>MAKEFLOW_OUTPUTS</tt> marks final target files that
should not be deleted.  However, different from <tt>MAKEFLOW_INPUTS</tt>, files
specified in <tt>MAKEFLOW_OUTPUTS</tt> does not include all output files. If
<tt>MAKEFLOW_OUTPUTS</tt> is not specified, then all files not used in subsequent
rules are considered outputs. It is considered best practice to always specify
<tt>MAKEFLOW_INPUTS/OUTPUTS</tt> to clearly specify which files are considered
inputs and outputs and allow for better space management if garbage collection
is used.</p>

<p>Makeflow offers two modes for garbage collection: reference count, and on
demand. With the reference count mode, intermediate files are deleted as soon
as no rule has them listed as input. The on-demand mode is similar to reference
count, only that files are deleted until the space on the local file system is
below a given threshold.</p>

<p>To activate reference count garbage collection:</p>

<code>makeflow -gref_count</code>

<p>To activate on-demand garbage collection, with a threshold of 500MB:</p>

<code>makeflow -gon_demand -G500000000</code>

<h2 id="logformat">Log File Format<a class="sectionlink" href="#logformat" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>After you  have executed the <tt>example.makeflow</tt> Makeflow script, you
should see a log file named <tt>example.makeflow.makeflowlog</tt> under the
directory where you ran the <tt>makeflow</tt> command.  The Makeflow log file
records how and when every task is run by Makeflow.  It exists primarily so
that Makeflow can recover cleanly after a failure, but can also be used for logging
and debugging.</p>

<p>A sample logfile might look like this:</p>

<p>
Each line in the log file represents a single action taken on a single rule in the workflow.
For simplicity, rules are numbered from the beginning of the Makeflow, starting with zero.
Each line contains the following items:
</p>
<code>timestamp task_id new_state job_id tasks_waiting tasks_running tasks_complete tasks_failed tasks_aborted task_id_counter</code>

<p>Which are defined as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>timestamp</b> - the unix time (in microseconds) when this line is written to the log file. </li>
	<li><b>task_id</b> - the id of this n. </li>
	<li><b>new_state</b> - a integer represents the new state this task (whose id is in the task_id column) has just entered. The value of the integer ranges from 0 to 4 and the states they are representing are:</li>
	<ol start="0">
		<li> waiting </li>
		<li> running </li>
		<li> complete </li>
		<li> failed </li>
		<li> aborted </li>
	</ol>
	<li><b>job_id</b> - the underline execution system is a batch system, such as Condor or SGE,
	the job id would be the job id assigned by the batch system when the task
	was sent to the batch system for execution.</li>
	<li><b>tasks_waiting</b> - the number of tasks are waiting to be executed.</li>
	<li><b>tasks_running</b> - the number of tasks are being executed.</li>
	<li><b>tasks_complete</b> - the number of tasks has been completed.</li>
	<li><b>tasks_failed</b> - the number of tasks has failed.</li>
	<li><b>tasks_aborted</b> - the number of tasks has been aborted.</li>
	<li><b>task_id_counter</b> - total number of tasks in this Makeflow</li>
</ul>

<p> In addition, lines starting with a pound sign are comments and
contain additional high-level information that can be safely ignored.
The logfile begins with a comment to indicate the starting time, and ends with
a comment indicating whether the entire workflow completed, failed, or was aborted.
</p>

<p>Aside from the high-level information, file states are also recorded in the log.
This allows for tracking files throughout the workflow execution. This information
is shown starting with the <tt>#</tt>:</p>

<code># new_state filename timestamp</code>

<p>Each file state line records the state change and time:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>new_state</b> - the integer represents the new state this file has just entered. The value of the integer ranges from 0 to 4 and the states they are representing are:</li>
	<ol start="0">
		<li> unknown </li>
		<li> expect </li>
		<li> exists </li>
		<li> complete </li>
		<li> delete </li>
	</ol>
	<li><b>filename</b> - the file name given in the rule specification of Makeflow.</li>
	<li><b>timestamp</b> - the unix time (in microseconds) when this line is written to the log file. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="custom.drivers">Custom Drivers<a class="sectionlink" href="#custom.drivers" title="Link to this section.">&#x21d7;</a></h2>

<p>For clusters that are not directly supported by Makeflow we strongly suggest
using the <a href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/workqueue">Work Queue</a> system
and submitting workers via the cluster's normal submission mechanism.</p>

<p>For clusters using managers similar to Torque, SGE, and PBS that submit
jobs with commands like "qsub", you can inform makeflow of those commands
and use the <tt>cluster</tt> driver.  For this to work, it is assumed
there is a distributed filesystem shared (like NFS) shared across all
nodes of the cluster.</p>

<p>To configure a custom driver, set the following environment variables:

<ul>
	<li>BATCH_QUEUE_CLUSTER_NAME: The name of the cluster, used in debugging messages and as the name for the wrapper script.</li>
	<li>BATCH_QUEUE_CLUSTER_SUBMIT_COMMAND: The submit command for the cluster (such as qsub or msub)</li>
	<li>BATCH_QUEUE_CLUSTER_SUBMIT_OPTIONS: The command-line arguments that must be passed to the submit command.  This string should end with the argument used to set the name of the task (usually -N).</li>
	<li>BATCH_QUEUE_CLUSTER_REMOVE_COMMAND: The delete command for the cluster (such as qdel or mdel)</li>
</ul>

<p>These will be used to construct a task submission for each makeflow rule that consists of:</p>

<code>$SUBMIT_COMMAND $SUBMIT_OPTIONS $CLUSTER_NAME.wrapper "&lt;rule commandline&gt;"</code>

<p>The wrapper script is a shell script that reads the command to be run as an argument and handles bookkeeping operations necessary for Makeflow.</p>
