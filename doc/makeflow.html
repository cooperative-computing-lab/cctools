<h2>Overview</h2>

Makeflow is a <b>workflow engine</b> for distributed computing.
It accepts a specification of a large amount of work to be
performed, and runs it on remote machines in parallel where possible.
In addition, Makeflow is fault-tolerant, so you can use it to coordinate
very large tasks that may run for days or weeks in the face of failures.
Makeflow is designed to be similar to <b>Make</b>, so if you can write
a Makefile, then you can write a Makeflow.
<p>
You can run a Makeflow on your local machine to test it out.
If you have a multi-core machine, then you can run multiple tasks simultaneously.
If you have a Condor pool or a Sun Grid Engine batch system, then you can send
your jobs there to run.  If you don't already have a batch system, Makeflow comes with a
system called Work Queue that will let you distribute the load across any collection
of machines, large or small.
<p>
Makeflow is part of the <a href=http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/software>Cooperating Computing Tools</a>.  You can download the CCTools from <a href=http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/software/download>this web page</a>, follow the <a href=install.html>installation instructions</a>, and you are ready to go.

<h2>The Makeflow Language</h2>

The Makeflow language is very similar to Make.
A Makeflow script consists of a set of rules.
Each rule specifies a set of <i>target files</i> to create,
a set of <i>source files</i> needed to create them,
and a <i>command</i> that generates the target files from the source files.
<p>
Makeflow attempts to generate all of the target files in a script.
It examines all of the rules and determines which rules must run before
others.  Where possible, it runs commands in parallel to reduce the
execution time.
<p>
Here is a Makeflow that uses the <tt>convert</tt> utility to make an animation.
It downloads an image from the web, creates four variations
of the image, and then combines them back together into an animation.
The first and the last task are marked as LOCAL to force them to
run on the controlling machine.

<pre>
CURL=/usr/bin/curl
CONVERT=/usr/bin/convert
URL=http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/images/capitol.jpg

capitol.montage.gif: capitol.jpg capitol.90.jpg capitol.180.jpg capitol.270.jpg capitol.360.jpg
        LOCAL $CONVERT -delay 10 -loop 0 capitol.jpg capitol.90.jpg capitol.180.jpg capitol.270.jpg capitol.360.jpg capitol.270.jpg capitol.180.jpg capitol.90.jpg capitol.montage.gif

capitol.90.jpg: capitol.jpg $CONVERT
        $CONVERT -swirl 90 capitol.jpg capitol.90.jpg

capitol.180.jpg: capitol.jpg $CONVERT
        $CONVERT -swirl 180 capitol.jpg capitol.180.jpg

capitol.270.jpg: capitol.jpg $CONVERT
        $CONVERT -swirl 270 capitol.jpg capitol.270.jpg

capitol.360.jpg: capitol.jpg $CONVERT
        $CONVERT -swirl 360 capitol.jpg capitol.360.jpg

capitol.jpg: $CURL
        LOCAL $CURL -o capitol.jpg $URL
</pre>

Note that Makeflow differs from Make in a few important ways.
Read section 4 below to get all of the details.

<h2>Running Makeflow</h2>

To try out the example above, copy and paste it into a file named <tt>example.makeflow</tt>.
To run it on your local machine:

<pre>
% makeflow example.makeflow
</pre>

Note that if you run it a second time, nothing will happen, because all of the files are built:

<pre>
% makeflow example.makeflow
makeflow: nothing left to do
</pre>

Use the <tt>-c</tt> option to clean everything up before trying it again:

<pre>
% makeflow -c example.makeflow
</pre>

If you have access to a batch system running <a href=http://www.sun.com/software/sge>SGE</a>,
then you can direct Makeflow to run your jobs there:

<pre>
% makeflow -T sge example.makeflow
</pre>

Or, if you have a <a href=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor>Condor Pool</a>,
then you can direct Makeflow to run your jobs there:

<pre>
% makeflow -T condor example.makeflow
</pre>

To submit Makeflow as a Condor job that submits more Condor jobs:

<pre>
% condor_submit_makeflow example.makeflow
</pre>

You will notice that a workflow can run very slowly if you submit
each batch job to SGE or Condor, because it typically
takes 30 seconds or so to start each batch job running.  To get
around this limitation, we provide the Work Queue system.
This allows Makeflow to function as a master process that 
quickly dispatches work to remote worker processes.
<p>
To begin, let's assume that you are logged into a machine
named <tt>barney.nd.edu</tt>. start your Makeflow like this:
<pre>
% makeflow -T wq example.makeflow
</pre>

Then, submit 10 worker processes to Condor like this:

<pre>
% condor_submit_workers barney.nd.edu 9123 10
Submitting job(s)..........
Logging submit event(s)..........
10 job(s) submitted to cluster 298.
</pre>

Or, submit 10 worker processes to SGE like this:
<pre>
% sge_submit_workers barney.nd.edu 9123 10
</pre>

Or, submit 10 worker processes to Torque like this:
<pre>
% torque_submit_workers barney.nd.edu 9123 10
</pre>

Or, you can start workers manually on any other machine you can log into:
<pre>
% work_queue_worker barney.nd.edu 9123
</pre>

Once the workers begin running, Makeflow will dispatch multiple
tasks to each one very quickly.  If a worker should fail, Makeflow
will retry the work elsewhere, so it is safe to submit many
workers to an unreliable system.
<p>
When the Makeflow completes, your workers will still be available,
so you can either run another Makeflow with the same workers,
remove them from the batch system, or wait for them to expire.
If you do nothing for 15 minutes, they will automatically exit.
<p>
Note that <tt>condor_submit_workers</tt>, <tt>sge_submit_workers</tt>,
and <tt>torque_submit_workers</tt>.
are simple shell scripts, so you can edit them directly if you would
like to change batch options or other details.

<h2>Resources Categories</h2>

Makeflow has the capability of automatically setting the cores, memory,
and disk space requirements to the underlying batch system (currently this only
works with Work Queue and Condor). Jobs are grouped into <em> job categories
</em>, and jobs in the same category have the same cores, memory, and disk
requirements.
<br>
<br>

Job categories and resources are specified with variables.  Jobs are assigned
to the category named in the value of the variable CATEGORY.  Likewise, the
values of the variables CORES, MEMORY (in MB), and DISK (in MB) describe the
resources requirements for the category specified in CATEGORY.
<br>
<br>

Jobs without an explicit category are assigned to <tt>default</tt>.
Jobs in the default category get their resource requirements from the value of
the environment variables CORES, MEMORY, and DISK.
<br>
<br>

Consider the following example:

<pre>
MEMORY=100
one: src
    cmd

CATEGORY="simulation"
DISK=500

CATEGORY="preprocessing"
MEMORY=200
DISK=200

two: src
    cmd

three: src
    cmd

CATEGORY="simulation"
DISK=700
four: src
    cmd

five: src
@CATEGORY="preprocessing"
    cmd

six: src
    cmd

CATEGORY="analysis"
CORES=1
MEMORY=400
DISK=400

seven: src
    cmd
</pre>

<pre>
export CORES=4
makeflow ...
</pre>

<h6> Job categories (job named after its output): </h6>

<dl>
<dt> preprocessing: </dt>
<dd> two, three, five </dd>
<dt> simulation: </dt>
<dd> four, six </dd>
<dt> analysis: </dt>
<dd> seven </dd>
<dt> default: </dt>
<dd> one </dd>
<tr>

<h6> Resources specified: </h6>
<table>
<th><tr><td> Category </td> <td> Cores </td> <td> Memory (MB) </td> <td> Disk (MB) </td> </tr></th>
<tr><td> preprocessing </td> <td> - </td> <td> 200 </td> <td> 200 </td> </tr>
<tr><td> simulation </td> <td> - </td> <td> - </td> <td> 700 </td> </tr>
<tr><td> analysis </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 400 </td> <td> 400 </td> </tr>
<tr><td> default_category </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 100 </td> <td> - </td> </tr>
</table>

<p> Note that in this example, in job <tt>five</tt>, the CATEGORY temporarily
has the value of "preprocessing", and then it is re-established to "simulation"
(so that <tt>four</tt> and <tt>six</tt> belong to the same category). This is
done using rule lexical scoping, explained in the next section.

<h2>The Fine Details</h2>

The Makeflow language is very similar to Make, but it does have a few important differences that you should be aware of.

<h3>Get the Dependencies Right</h3>

You must be careful to accurately specify <b>all of the files that a rule requires and creates</b>, including any custom executables.  This is because Makeflow requires all these information to construct the environment for a remote job.  For example, suppose that you have written a simulation program called <tt>mysim.exe</tt> that reads <tt>calib.data</tt> and then produces and output file.  The following rule won't work, because it doesn't inform Makeflow what files are neded to execute the simulation:
<pre>
# This is an incorrect rule.

output.txt:
        ./mysim.exe -c calib.data -o output.txt
</pre>

However, the following is correct, because the rule states all of the files needed to run the simulation.  Makeflow will use this information to
construct a batch job that consists of <tt>mysim.exe</tt> and <tt>calib.data</tt> and uses it to produce <tt>output.txt</tt>:

<pre>
# This is a correct rule.

output.txt: mysim.exe calib.data
        ./mysim.exe -c calib.data -o output.txt
</pre>
When a regular file is specified as an input file, it means the command relies on the contents of that file. When a directory is specified as an input file, however, it could mean one of two things. First, the command depends on the contents inside the directory. Second, the command relies on the existence of the directory (for example, you just want to add more things into the directory later, it does not matter what's already in it). <b>Makeflow assumes that an input directory indicates that the command relies on the directory's existence</b>.

<h3>No Phony Rules</h3>

For a similar reason, you cannot have "phony" rules that don't actually
create the specified files.  For example, it is common practice to define
a <tt>clean</tt> rule in Make that deletes all derived files.  This doesn't
make sense in Makeflow, because such a rule does not actually create 
a file named <tt>clean</tt>.  Instead use the <tt>-c</tt> option as shown above.

<h3>Just Plain Rules</h3>

Makeflow does not support all of the syntax that you find in various versions of Make.  Each rule must have exactly one command to execute.  If you have multiple commands, simply join them together with semicolons.  Makeflow allows you to define and use variables, but it does not support  pattern rules, wildcards, or special variables like <tt>$&lt;</tt> or <tt>$@</tt>.  You simply have to write out the rules longhand, or write a script in your favorite language to generate a large Makeflow.

<h3>Local Job Execution</h3>

Certain jobs don't make much sense to distribute.  For example, if you have a very fast running job that consumes a large amount of data, then it should simply run on the same machine as Makeflow.  To force this, simply add the word <tt>LOCAL</tt> to the beginning of the command line in the rule.

<h3>Rule Lexical Scope</h3>

Variables in Makeflow have global scope, that is, once defined,
their value can be accessed from any rule. Sometimes it is useful to
define a variable locally inside a rule, without affecting the global value. In
Makeflow, this can be achieved by defining the variables after the rule's
requirements, but before the rule's command, and prepending the name of the
variable with <tt>@</tt>, as follows:

<pre>
SOME_VARIABLE=original_value

#rule 1 target_1: source_1
	command_1

#rule 2 target_2: source_2
@SOME_VARIABLE=local_value_for_2
	command_2

#rule 3 target_3: source_3
	command_3 </pre>

In this example, SOME_VARIABLE has the value 'original_value' for rules 1 and
3, and the value 'local_value_for_2' for rule 2.


<h3>Batch Job Refinement</h3>

When executing jobs, Makeflow simply uses the default settings in your batch
system.  If you need to pass additional options, use the <tt>BATCH_OPTIONS</tt>
variable or the <tt>-B</tt> option to Makeflow.

When executing jobs, Makeflow simply uses the default settings in your batch system.  If you need to pass additional options, use the <tt>BATCH_OPTIONS</tt> variable or the <tt>-B</tt> option to Makeflow.
<p>
When using Condor, this string will be added to each submit file.  For example, if you want to add <tt>Requirements</tt> and <tt>Rank</tt> lines to your Condor submit files, add this to your Makeflow:
<pre>
BATCH_OPTIONS = Requirements = (Memory>1024)
</pre>
<p>
When using SGE, the string will be added to the qsub options.  For example, to specify that jobs should be submitted to the <tt>devel</tt> queue:
<pre>
BATCH_OPTIONS = -q devel
</pre>


<h3>Remote File Renaming</h3>

With the Work Queue and Condor batch systems, Makeflow has a
feature called remote file renaming. For example:

<pre>
local_name->remote_name
</pre>

indicates that the file <tt>local_name</tt> is called
<tt>remote_name</tt> in the remote system. Consider the following
example:

<pre>
b.out: a.in myprog
        LOCAL myprog a.in > b.out 

c.out->out: a.in->in1 b.out myprog->prog
        prog in1 b.out > out
</pre>

The first rule runs locally, using the executable <tt>myprog</tt>
and the local file <tt>a.in</tt> to locally create <tt>b.out</tt>.
The second rule runs remotely, but the remote system
expects <tt>a.in</tt> to be named <tt>in1</tt>, <tt>c.out</tt>,
to be named <tt>out</tt> and so on. Note that we did not need to
rename the file <tt>b.out</tt>. Without remote file renaming, we
would have to create either a symbolic link, or a copy of the
files with the expected correct names. 

<h3>Displaying a Makeflow</h3>

When run with the <tt>-D</tt> option, Makeflow will emit a diagram of the Makeflow in the
<a href=http://www.graphviz.org>Graphviz DOT</a> format.  If you have <tt>dot</tt> installed,
then you can generate an image of your workload like this:

<pre>
% makeflow -D example.makeflow | dot -T gif > example.gif
</pre>

<h3>Total number of tasks in a Makeflow</h3>
The following command parses Makeflow's '-D' option output and returns the
total number of tasks in the given Makeflow script:
<pre>
% makeflow -D example.makeflow | grep '^N[0-9]\+ \[label=' | wc -l
</pre>

<h2>Running Makeflow with Work Queue</h2>

With the '-T wq' option, Makeflow runs as a master process that dispatches
tasks to remote worker processes using the <a href=workqueue.html>Work Queue</a> framework.

<h3>Selecting a Port</h3>

Makeflow listens on a port which the remote workers would connect to.
The default port number is 9123.  Sometimes, however, the port number might be
not available on your system. You can change the default port via the '-p
&lt;port number&gt;' option. For example, if you want the master to listen on port
9567 by default, you can run the following command: 

<pre>
% makeflow -T wq -p 9567 example.makeflow
</pre>

<h3>Project Names</h3>

A simpler way to match workers to masters is to use the
project name matching. You can give the master a project name with the -N option.

<pre> 
% makeflow -T wq -a -N MyProj example.makeflow 
</pre> 
The -N option gives the master a project name called 'MyProj'. The -a option
enables the catalog mode of the master.  Only in the catalog mode a master
would advertise its information, such as the project name, running status,
hostname and port number, to a catalog server. Then a worker could retrieve
these information from the same catalog server.  The above command uses the
default catalog server at Notre Dame which runs 24/7. We will talk about how to
set up your own catalog server later.

<p>
To start a worker that automatically finds MyProj's master via the default Notre
Dame catalog server:
<pre>
% work_queue_worker -a -N MyProj 
</pre>
The '-a' option enables the catalog mode on the worker, which tells the worker
to contact a catalog server to find out a project's (specified by -N option)
hostname and port.  
<p>
You can also give multiple -N options to a worker. The worker will find out
which ones of the specified projects are running from the catalog server and
randomly select one to work for. When one project is done, the worker would
repeat this process.  Thus, the worker can work for a different master without
being stopped and given the different master's hostname and port. An example of
specifying multiple projects:
<pre>
% work_queue_worker -a -N proj1 -N proj2 -N proj3
</pre>

<h3>Setting a Password</h3>

We recommend that any workflow that uses a project name also set
a password.  To do this, select any passphrase and write it to
a file called <tt>mypwfile</tt>.  Then, run Makeflow and each
worker with the <tt>--password</tt> option to indicate the password file:

<pre>
% makeflow <b>--password</b> mypwfile ...
% work_queue_worker <b>--password</b> mypwfile ...
</pre>
</pre>

<h3>Catalog Server</h3>

<p>
Now let's look at how to set up your own catalog server. Say you want to run
your catalog server on a machine named <tt>catalog.somewhere.edu</tt>.  Tthe default port that the catalog server will be listening on is 9097, you can change it via the '-p' option.
<pre>
% catalog_server
</pre>
Now you have a catalog server listening at catalog.somewhere.edu:9097. To make your
masters and workers contact this catalog server, simply add the '-C
hostname:port' option to both of your master and worker: 
<pre>
% makeflow -T wq -C catalog.somewhere.edu:9097 -N MyProj example.makeflow
% work_queue_worker -C catalog.somewhere.edu:9097 -a -N MyProj 
</pre>

<h3>Supported Makeflow Drivers</h3>
The full list of supported Makeflow drivers include
<ul>
	<li>Local - local execution on a single multicore system</li>
	<li>Condor - execution on a campus grid via the local <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor">Condor Pool</a></li>
	<li>SGE - execution on a high-performance cluster using the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/tools/oracle-grid-engine-075549.html">Oracle Grid Engine</a> (formerly the Sun Grid Engine).</li>
	<li>Moab - execution on a high-performance cluster using the <a href="http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/resources/docs/mwm/6-0/index.php">Moab Workload Manager</a></li>
	<li>Cluster - execution on a high-performance cluster using a user-defined cluster manager</li>
	<li>Work Queue - execution on a lightweight, scalable master-worker <a href="http://nd.edu/~ccl/software/workqueue/">framework</a> managed directly by Makeflow</li>
	<li>Hadoop - execution on a cluster managed by the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> framework, using data stored in <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/hdfs">HDFS</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>User-defined Clusters</h4>
For clusters that are not directly supported by Makeflow we strongly suggest using the
<a href="http://nd.edu/~ccl/software/workqueue">Work Queue</a> system and submitting workers
via the cluster's normal submission mechanism.

<p>
For clusters using managers similar to SGE or Moab that are configured to preclude the use of Work Queue we have
the "Cluster" custom driver.  To use the "Cluster" driver the Makeflow must be run in a parallel filesystem available to the
entire cluster, and the following environment variables must be set.
<ul>
	<li>BATCH_QUEUE_CLUSTER_NAME: The name of the cluster, used in debugging messages and as the name for the wrapper script.</li>
	<li>BATCH_QUEUE_CLUSTER_SUBMIT_COMMAND: The submit command for the cluster (such as qsub or msub)</li>
	<li>BATCH_QUEUE_CLUSTER_SUBMIT_OPTIONS: The command-line arguments that must be passed to the submit command.  This string should end with the argument used to set the name of the task (usually -N).</li>
	<li>BATCH_QUEUE_CLUSTER_REMOVE_COMMAND: The delete command for the cluster (such as qdel or mdel)</li>
</ul>

These will be used to construct a task submission for each makeflow rule that consists of
<pre>
% $SUBMIT_COMMAND $SUBMIT_OPTIONS "&lt;rule name&gt;" $CLUSTER_NAME.wrapper "&lt;rule commandline&gt;"
</pre>
The wrapper script is a shell script that reads the command to be run as an argument and handles bookkeeping operations necessary for Makeflow.

<h2>Makeflow Log File Format</h2>
After you  have executed the <tt>example.makeflow</tt> Makeflow script, you
should see a log file named <tt>example.makeflow.makeflowlog</tt> under the
directory where you ran the <tt>makeflow</tt> command.  The Makeflow log file
records all the tasks that Makeflow tries to run and how the tasks status
change during the previous executions.  

<p>
In Makeflow, each task is called a node. You can think of it as a tree node in
a tree structure of the target workflow. There is a unique id, a positive
integer, associated with each node. This id is referred as node id. The
Makeflow log file starts with a list of node (task) descriptions where each
task is specified in the following format:

<pre>
# NODE node_id original_command
# SYMBOL node_id symbol
# PARENTS node_id parent_node_id_1 parent_node_id_2 ... parent_node_id_n
# SOURCES node_id source_file_1 source_file_2 ... source_file_n
# TARGETS node_id target_file_1 target_file_2 ... target_file_n
# COMMAND node_id translated_command
</pre>

These annotation lines all start with '#' and will be treated as comments by
Makeflow. When Makeflow tries to resume the execution of a Makeflow script from
a existing Makeflow log file, it will skip the scanning of these commented
lines. Also, annotations being commented out allows third-party applications,
such as gnuplot, to skip them when plotting data.

<p>
The body sections of a Makeflow log file come after the node specificiation
section. The following is a snippet from <tt>example.makeflow.makeflowlog</tt>:
<pre>
# STARTED timestamp
1347281321284638 5 1 9206 5 1 0 0 0 6
1347281321348488 5 2 9206 5 0 1 0 0 6
1347281321348760 4 1 9207 4 1 1 0 0 6
1347281321348958 3 1 9208 3 2 1 0 0 6

1347281325731146 0 2 9215 0 0 6 0 0 6
# COMPLETED timestamp
</pre>

If a Makeflow execution is completed without errors, a body section of the log
consists of a series of node (task) status change lines (the 10 column line)
surrounded by a pair of "# STARTED" and "# COMPLETED" lines which record the
start and end unix time of that execution.  A node status change line has the
following form: 
<pre>
timestamp node_id new_state job_id nodes_waiting nodes_running nodes_complete nodes_failed nodes_aborted node_id_counter
</pre>
Here is the column specificiation:
<ul>
	<li><b>timestamp</b> - the unix time (in microseconds) when this line is written to the log file. </li>
	<li><b>node_id</b> - the id of this node (task). </li>
	<li><b>new_state</b> - a integer represents the new state this node (whose id is in the node_id column) has just entered. The value of the integer ranges from 0 to 4 and the states they are representing are:</li>
	<ol start="0">
		<li> waiting </li>
		<li> running </li>
		<li> complete </li>
		<li> failed </li>
		<li> aborted </li>
	</ol>
	<li><b>job_id</b> - the job id of this node in the underline execution
	system (local or batch system). If the Makeflow is executed locally, the
	job id would be the process id of the process that executes this node. If
	the underline execution system is a batch system, such as Condor or SGE,
	the job id would be the job id assigned by the batch system when the task
	was sent to the batch system for execution.</li>
	<li><b>nodes_waiting</b> - the number of nodes are waiting to be executed.</li>
	<li><b>nodes_running</b> - the number of nodes are being executed.</li>
	<li><b>nodes_complete</b> - the number of nodes has been completed.</li>
	<li><b>nodes_failed</b> - the number of nodes has failed.</li>
	<li><b>nodes_aborted</b> - the number of nodes has been aborted.</li>
	<li><b>node_id_counter</b> - total number of nodes in this Makeflow</li>
</ul>

You might also see the following two lines in the Makeflow log file if the
Makeflow is aborted or failed during a execution. The unix time at which such
event occured is recorded:
<pre>
# ABORTED timestamp
# FAILED timestamp
</pre>

<tt>Makeflow</tt> garbage-collects system memory associate with each task at
runtime. The Makeflow log file also logs the garbage collection activities. You
will find garbage collection related lines start with the '# GC' prefix:
<pre>
# GC timestamp collected time_spent dag_gc_collected
</pre>
Each garbage collection line records the garbage collection statistics during a
garbage collection cycle: 
<ul>
	<li><b>timestamp</b> - the unix time (in microseconds) when this line is written to the log file. </li>

<h2>Linking Workflow Dependencies</h2>
<tt>Makeflow</tt> provides a tool to collect all of the dependencies for a given workflow into one directory. By collecting all of the input files and programs contained in a workflow it is possible to run the workflow on other machines.

Currently, <tt>Makeflow</tt> copies all of the files specified as dependencies by the rules in the makeflow file, including scripts and data files. Some of the files not collected are dynamically linked libraries, executables not listed as dependencies (<tt>python</tt>, <tt>perl</tt>), and configuration files (<tt>mail.rc</tt>).

To avoid naming conflicts, files which would otherwise have an identical path are renamed when copied into the bundle
<ul>
  <li>All file paths are relative to the top level directory.</li>
  <li>The makeflow file is rewritten with the new file locations and placed in the top level directory.</li>
  <li>Files originally specified with an absolute path are placed into the top level directory.</li>
  <li>Files with the same path are appended with a unique number</li>
</ul>

Example usage:
<pre>
% makeflow -b some_output_directory example.makeflow
</pre>
