      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <b>resource_monitor</b> is a tool to monitor the computational
      resources used by the process created by the command given as an
      argument, and all its descendants.  The monitor works
      'indirectly', that is, by observing how the environment changed
      while a process was running, therefore all the information
      reported should be considered just as an estimate (this is in
      contrast with direct methods, such as ptrace). It has been tested
      in Linux, FreeBSD, and Darwin, and can be used in stand-alone
      mode, or automatically with
      <tt>makeflow</tt> and <tt>work queue</tt> applications.
      <p>

      <b>resource_monitor</b> generates up to three log files: a summary
      file with the maximum values of resource used, a time-series that
      shows the resources used at given time intervals, and a list of
      files that were opened during execution.
      <p>

      Maximum resource limits can be specified in the
      form of a file, or a string given at the command line. If one of
      the resources goes over the limit specified, then the monitor
      terminates the task, and reports which resource went over the
      respective limits.
      <p>

      In systems that support it, <b>resource_monitor</b> wraps some
      libc functions to obtain a better estimate of the resources used.
      In contrast, <b>resource_monitorv</b> disables this wrapping,
      which means, among others, that it can only monitor the root
      process, but not its descendants.
      <p>

      <p>

      <h2>Installation</h2>

      The <b>resource_monitor</b> is included in the <b>current development version</b> of
      <a href=http://http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/software/download.shtml>CCTools</a>. For installation, please follow these <a href=http://www3.nd.edu/~ccl/software/manuals/install.html>instructions.</a>

      <h2>Running resource_monitor</h2>

     <h3> Stand-alone mode </h3>

     Simply type:

      <pre>
	% resource_monitor -- ls </pre>

     This will generate three files describing the resource usage of
     the command "ls". These files are <tt>
resource-pid-PID.summary</tt>, <tt>
resource-pid-PID.series</tt>, and <tt>resource-pid-PID.files,</tt> in
which PID represents the
corresponding process id. Alternatively, we can specify the output
names, and the sampling intervals:

      <pre>
	% resource_monitor -o log-sleep -i 2 -- sleep 10 </pre>

      The previous command will monitor "sleep 10", at two second
      intervals, and will generate the
      files <tt>log-sleep.summary</tt>, <tt>log-sleep.series</tt>,
      and <tt>log-sleep.files</tt>.

      Currently, the monitor does not support interactive
      applications. That is, if a process issues a read call from
      standard input, and standard input has not been redirected, then
      the tree process is terminated. This is likely to change in
      future versions of the tool.

      <h3> Makeflow mode </h3>

      If you already have a makeflow file, you can activate the
      resource_monitor by simply giving the <tt>-M</tt> to makeflow:

      <pre>
	% makeflow -M Makeflow </pre>

      In this case, makeflow wraps every command line rule with the
      monitor, and writes the resulting logs per rule in an
      automatically created directory.

      <h3> Work-queue mode </h3>

      From Work Queue:

      <pre>
	q = work_queue_create_monitoring(port);
	work_queue_enable_monitoring(q, some-log-file); </pre>

      wraps every task with the monitor, and appends all generated
      summary files into the file <tt>some-log-file</tt>. Currently
      only summary reports are generated from work queue.

      <h3> Monitoring with Condor </h3>

      Unlike the previous examples, when using
      the <tt>resource_monitor</tt> directly with <b>condor</b>, you
      have to specify the <tt>resource_monitor</tt> as an input file,
      and the generated log files as output files. For example,
      consider the following submission file:

      <pre>
	universe = vanilla
	executable = /bin/echo
	arguments = hello condor
	output = test.output
	should_transfer_files = yes
	when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
	log = condor.test.logfile
	queue </pre>

      This can be rewritten, for example, as:

      <pre>
	universe = vanilla
	executable = /path/to/resource_monitor
	arguments = -o echo-log -- /bin/echo hello condor
	output = test.output echo-log.summary echo-log.series echo-log.files
	should_transfer_files = yes
	when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
	log = condor.test.logfile
	queue </pre>
      

      <h2>Output Format</h2>

      The summary file has the following format:

      <pre>
	command: [the command line given as an argument]
	start:                     [seconds at the start of execution, since the epoch, float]
	end:                       [seconds at the end of execution, since the epoch,   float]
	exit_type:                 [one of normal, signal or limit,                    string]
	signal:                    [number of the signal that terminated the process.
	                            Only present if exit_type is signal                   int]
	limits_exceeded:           [resources over the limit. Only present if
	                            exit_type is limit,                                string]
	exit_status:               [final status of the parent process,                   int]
	max_concurrent_processes:  [the maximum number of processes running concurrently, int]
	wall_time:                 [seconds spent during execution, end - start,        float]
	cpu_time:                  [user + system time of the execution, in seconds,    float]
	virtual_memory:            [maximum virtual memory across all processes, in KB,   int]
	resident_memory:           [maximum resident size across all processes, in KB,    int]
	swap_memory:               [maximum swap usage across all processes, in KB,       int]
	bytes_read:                [number of bytes read from disk,                       int]
	bytes_written:             [number of bytes written to disk,                      int]
	workdir_number_files_dirs: [total maximum number of files and directories of
	                            all the working directories in the tree,              int]
	workdir_footprint:         [size in bytes of all working directories in the tree, int]
	</pre>

      The time-series log has a row per time sample. For each row, the columns have the following meaning:

      <pre>
	wall_clock                [the sample time, since the epoch, in microseconds,      int]
	concurrent_processes      [concurrent processes at the time of the sample,         int]
	cpu_time                  [accumulated user + kernel time, in microseconds,        int]
	virtual_memory            [current virtual memory size, in KB,                     int]
	resident_memory           [current resident memory size, in KB,                    int]
	swap_memory               [current swap usage, in KB,                              int]
	bytes_read                [accumulated number of bytes read,                       int]
	bytes_written             [accumulated number of bytes written,                    int]
	workdir_number_files_dirs [current number of files and directories, across all
	                           working directories in the tree,                        int]
	workdir_footprint         [current byte size of working directories in the tree,   int]
	</pre>
      
      <h2>Specifying Resource Limits</h2>

      The limits file should contain lines of the form:

      <pre>
	resource: max_value </pre>

      It may contain any of the following fields, in the same units as
      defined for the summary file:

      <tt>max_concurrent_processes</tt>,
      <tt>wall_time, cpu_time</tt>,
      <tt>virtual_memory, resident_memory, swap_memory</tt>,
      <tt>bytes_read, bytes_written</tt>,
      <tt>workdir_number_files_dirs, workdir_footprint</tt>

      Thus, for example, to automatically kill a process after one hour, or if it is using 5GB of swap, we can create the following file <tt>limits.txt</tt>:

      <pre>
	wall_time: 3600
	swap_memory: 5242880 </pre>

      In <tt>makeflow</tt> we then specify:

      <pre>
	makeflow -M --monitor-limits=limits.txt </pre>

      Or with <tt>condor:</tt>
	
      <pre>
	universe = vanilla
	executable = matlab
	arguments = -o matlab-script-log --limits-file=limits.txt -- matlab < script.m
	output = matlab.output matlab-script-log.summary matlab-script-log.series matlab-script-log.files
	transfer_input_files=script.m limits.txt
	should_transfer_files = yes
	when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
	log = condor.matlab.logfile
	queue </pre>
