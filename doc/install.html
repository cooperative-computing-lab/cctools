<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The Cooperative Computing Tools (cctools) are a collection of programs
that enable large scale distributed computing on systems such as
clusters, clouds, and grids.  These tools are commonly used in fields
of science and engineering that rely on large amounts of computing.
</p>

<h2>Install from Binary Tarball</h2>

<p>
Binary packages are available for several operating systems at the
<a href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/download.shtml">download page</a>
Simply unpack the tarball in any directory that you like,
and then add the <tt>bin</tt> directory to your path.
For example, to install cctools 6.0.15 for RHEL7 in your home directory:
</p>

<code>cd $HOME
wget http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/files/cctools-6.0.15-x86_64-redhat7.tar.gz
gunzip cctools-6.0.15-x86_64-redhat7.tar.gz
tar xvf cctools-6.0.15-x86_64-redhat7.tar
export PATH=$HOME/cctools-6.0.15-x86_64-redhat7/bin:$PATH
</code>

<h2>Install From Source Tarball</h2>

<p>
Download a source package from the <a href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/download.shtml">download page</a>.
And follow this recipe while logged in as any ordinary user:
</p>

<code>wget http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/files/cctools-6.0.15-source.tar.gz
gunzip cctools-6.0.15-source.tar.gz
tar xvf cctools-6.0.15-source.tar
cd cctools-6.0.15-source
./configure
make
make install
export PATH=${HOME}/cctools/bin:$PATH
</code>

<h2>Install From Git Repository</h2>

<p>
Or, you can directly build the latest version from our git repository:
</p>

<code>git clone https://github.com/cooperative-computing-lab/cctools cctools-source
cd cctools-source
./configure
make
make install
export PATH=${HOME}/cctools/bin:$PATH
</code>

<h2>Special Cases</h2>

<p>
The software will happily build and run without installing
any external packages.  Optionally, the cctools will interoperate
with a variety of external packages for security and data access.
To use these, you must download and install them separately:
</p>

<dir>
<li> <a href="http://www.irods.org">iRODS</a> (version 4.0.3)
<li> <a href="http://www.globus.org">Globus</a> (version 5.0.3)
<li> <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net">FUSE</a>
<li> <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a>
<li> <a href="http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu">xRootD</a>
</dir>

<p>
Once the desired packages are correctly installed, unpack the cctools and
then issue a configure command that points to all of the other
installations.  Then, make and install as before.  For example:
</p>

<code>./configure --with-globus-path /usr/local/globus ...
make
make install
export PATH=${HOME}/cctools/bin:$PATH
</code>

<p>
Building Parrot with support for the iRODS service requires
some custom build instructions, since Parrot requires access
to some internals of iRODS that are not usually available.
To do this, first make a source build of iRODS in your home directory:
</p>

<code>cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/irods/irods-source
cd irods-source
git checkout 4.0.3
packaging/build.sh --run-in-place icommands
</code>

<p>
Then, configure and build cctools relative to that installation:
</p>

<code>git clone https://github.com/cooperative-computing-lab/cctools cctools-source
cd cctools-source
./configure <b>--with-irods-path $HOME/irods-src ...</b>
make
make install
</code>

<h2>Build on Mac OSX</h2>

<p>
In order to build CCTools on Mac OS X
you must first have the Xcode Command Line Tools installed.
For OS X 10.9 and later this can be done using the following command:
</p>

<code>xcode-select --install
</code>

<p>
Then, click "Install" in the window that appears on the screen.
If the command line tools are already installed,
you will get an error and can proceed
with the instructions in the
"Installing From Source" section above.
For OS X versions before 10.9,
you will need to first install Xcode.
Xcode can be found in the App Store or on the installation disk.
