# TaskVine Example: Computational Fluid Dynamics

This workflow utilizes Ansys Fluent to run multiple computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations on a matrix of angle of attack and Mach number
input parameters where each simulation outputs the aerodynamic forces and
torques on an input mesh. This script has been utilized by the Notre Dame
Rocketry Team to understand the aerodynamic forces experienced by a high
power rocket launch vehicle.
