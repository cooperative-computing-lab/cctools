# TaskVine User's Manual

## Overview

TaskVine is an framework for building large scale data
intensive dynamic workflows that run on high performance computing (HPC)
clusters, GPU clusters, cloud service providers, and other distributed computing systems.

A TaskVine application consists of a manager and a large number of
worker processes.  The application generates a large number of small
tasks, which are distributed to workers.
As tasks access external data sources and produce their own outputs,
more and more data is pulled into local storage on cluster nodes.
This data is used to accelerate future tasks and avoid re-computing exisiting results.
The application gradually grows "like a vine" through
the cluster.

TaskVine manager applications can be written in Python or C
on Linux or OSX platforms.  Individual tasks can be simple
Python functions, complex Unix applications, or serverless function
invocations. Several different programming models can be used,
including submit-wait, task futures, and bulk-synchronous-parallel.

TaskVine is easy to deploy on existing HPC and cloud facilities.
The worker processes are self-contained executables, and TaskVine
arranges for all necessary task dependencies to be moved to workers,
making the system self-hosting.  Applications regularly consist of
millions of tasks running on thousands of workers.

TaskVine is our third-generation workflow system, built on our
twenty years of experience creating scalable applications in
fields such as high energy physics, bioinformatics, molecular dynamics,
and machine learning.

## Quick Start in Python

There are a variety of ways to install TaskVine, depending on your local environment.
In most cases, installing via `conda` is the easiest method.
Please see our [full installation instructions](../install) for other options.

First, [Install Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you haven't done so before.
Then, open a terminal and install `ndcctools` like this:

```
conda install -c conda-forge ndcctools
```

Using a text editor, create a manager program called `manager.py` like this:

```
--8<-- "taskvine/examples/vine_python_function.py"
```

Run the manager program at the command line like this:

```
python manager.py
```

It should display output like this:
```
listening on port 9123
submitting tasks...
waiting for tasks to complete...
```

The manager is now waiting for workers to connect and begin
requesting work. (Without any workers, it will wait forever.) You can start
one worker on the same machine by opening a new shell and running:

```
vine_worker localhost 9123
```

The manager will send tasks to the worker for execution.  As they complete, you will see output like this:
```
task 1 exited with output 10
task 2 exited with output 20
...
all done.
```

(You can also declare and launch directly from python using the [TaskVine factory.](#using-the-factory-with-python))

Congrats! You have now run a simple manager application that runs tasks on one local worker.
Read on to learn how to build more complex applications and run large numbers of workers at scale.

## Principle of Operation

A TaskVine application is a large parallel application consisting of a **manager** and multiple **workers**.
The manager defines a large number of **tasks**, each of which is a discrete unit
of work that can be executed in parallel.
Each task is submitted to a **manager**, which makes
it available for a worker to execute.  Each worker connects to the manager, receives tasks
to execute, and returns results back to the manager. The manager receives results in the order that
they complete, and may submit further tasks as needed. Commonly used files are cached
at each worker to speed up execution.

Tasks come in two types:

- A **standard task** is a single Unix command line to execute, along with its needed input files.  Upon completion, it will produce one or more output files to be returned to the manager.
- A **PythonTask** is a single Python function to execute, along with its needed arguments.  Upon completion, it will produce a Python value (or an exception) as a result to return to the master.

Both types of tasks share a common set of options.  Each task can be labelled with the **resources**
(CPU cores, GPU devices, memory, disk space) that it needs to execute.  This allows each worker to pack the appropriate
number of tasks.  For example, a worker running on a 64-core machine could run 32 dual-core tasks, 16 four-core tasks,
or any other combination that adds up to 64 cores.  If you don't know the resources needed, you can enable
a **resource monitor** to track and report what each task uses.

To run a large application at scale, you must start a number of Workers in parallel.
If you are using a university cluster or HPC system, then you will likely be submitting
the workers to a batch system such as HTCondor, SLURM, or SGE.  If you are using a commercial
cloud, then you can run your workers inside of virtual machines.  We provide a number of
scripts to facilitate starting workers this way, or you can arrange things yourself to
simply run the `vine_worker` executable.

## Writing a Manager Program

A manager program can be written in Python, or C.
In each language, the underlying principles are the same, but there are some syntactic differences shown below.
The full API documentation for each language is here:

- [TaskVine Python API](../api/html/namespacetaskvinePython.html)
- [TaskVine C API](../api/html/taskvine_8h.html)

The basic outline of a manager program is:

1. Create the manager object.
2. Create tasks and attach input files.
3. Wait for a task to complete.
4. Process the outputs of that task.
5. If more tasks are outstanding, return to step 3.

### Creating a Manager Object

To begin, you must import the TaskVine library, and then create a Manager object.
You may specific a specific port number to listen on like this:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    # Import the taskvine library
    import taskvine as vine

    # Create a new manager listening on port 9123
    m = vine.Manager(9123)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```
    /* Import the taskvine library */
    #include "taskvine.h"

    /* Create a new queue listening on port 9123 */
    struct taskvine *m = vine_create(9123);
    ```

Of course, that specific port might already be in use, and so you may
specify zero to indicate any available port, and then use `m.port` to
discover which port was obtained:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    # Create a new manager listening on any port
    m = vine.Manager(0)
    print("listening on port {}".format(m.port))
    ```

=== "C"
    ```
    /* Create a new manager listening on any port */
    struct taskvine *m = vine_create(0);
    printf("listening on port %d\n",vine_port(m));

    ```

### Creating Standard Tasks

A **standard task** consists of a Unix command line to execute, along with
a statement of what data is needed as input, and what data will
be produced by the command. Input data can be provided in the form of a file
or a local memory buffer. Output data can be provided in the form of a file or
the standard output of the program.

Here is an example of a task that consists of the standard Unix `gzip` program,
which will read the file `my-file` and produce `my-file.gz` as an output:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    t = vine.Task("./gzip < my-file > my-file.gz")
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    struct vine_task *t = vine_task_create("./gzip < my-file > my-file.gz");
    ```

It is not enough to simply state the command line.  In addition, the
input and output files associated with the task must be accurately stated.
This is because the input files will be copied
over to the worker, and the output files will be brough back to the manager.

In this example, the task will require `my-file` as an input file,
and produce `my-file.gz` as an output file.  If the executable program
itself is not already installed at the worker, then it should also be
specified as an input file, so that it will be copied to the worker.

In addition, any input file that will remain unchanged through the
course of the application should be marked as **cacheable**.
This will allow the worker to keep a single copy of the file and share
it between multiple tasks that need it.

Here is how to describe the files needed by this task:


=== "Python"
    ```python
    # t.add_input_file("name at manager", "name when copied at execution site", ...)

    t.add_input_file("/usr/bin/gzip", "gzip",       cache = True)
    t.add_input_file("my-file",       "my-file",    cache = False)
    t.add_output_file("my-file.gz",   "my-file.gz", cache = False)

    # when the name at manager is the same as the exection site, we can write instead:
    t.add_input_file("my-file",     cache = False)
    t.add_output_file("my-file.gz", cache = False)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    # vine_task_add_file(t, "name at manager", "name when copied at execution site", ...)

    vine_task_add_file(t, "/usr/bin/gzip", "gzip",       VINE_INPUT,  VINE_CACHE);
    vine_task_add_file(t, "my-file",       "my-file",    VINE_INPUT,  VINE_NOCACHE);
    vine_task_add_file(t, "my-file.gz",    "my-file.gz", VINE_OUTPUT, VINE_NOCACHE);
    ```

When the task actually executes, the worker will create a **sandbox** directory,
which serves as the working directory for the task.  Each of the input files
and directories will be copied into the sandbox directory.
The task outputs should be written into the current working directory.
The path of the sandbox directory is exported to
the execution environment of each worker through the `VINE_SANDBOX` shell
environment variable. This shell variable can be used in the execution
environment of the worker to describe and access the locations of files in the
sandbox directory.

### Describing Tasks

In addition to describing the input and output files, you may optionally
specify additional details about the task that will assist taskvine in
making good scheduling decisions.

If you are able, describe the resources needed by each task (cores, gpus,
memory, disk) so that the worker can pack as many concurrent tasks.
This is described in greater detail under [Managing Resources](#managing-resources).

You may also attach a `tag` to a task, which is just an user-defined string
that describes the purpose of the task.  The tag is available as `t.tag`
when the task is complete.

=== "Python"
    ```python
    t.set_cores(2)
    t.set_memory(4096)
    t.set_tag("config-4.5.0")
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_task_set_cores(t,2);
    vine_task_set_memory(t,4096);
    vine_task_set_tag(t,"config-4.5.0");
    ```

### Managing Tasks

Once a task has been fully specified, it can be submitted to the queue.
`submit` returns a unique taskid that can be helpful when later referring
to a task:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    taskid = m.submit(t)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    int taskid = vine_submit(m,t);
    ```

Once all tasks are submitted, use `wait` to wait until a task completes,
indicating how many seconds you are willing to pause.  If a task completes
within that time limit, then `wait` will return that task object.
If no task completes within the timeout, it returns null.

=== "Python"
    ```python
    while not m.empty():
        t = m.wait(5)
        if t:
            print("Task {} has returned!".format(t.id))

            if t.return_status == 0:
                print("command exit code:\n{}".format(t.exit_code))
                print("stdout:\n{}".format(t.output))
            else:
                print("There was a problem executing the task.")
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    while(!vine_empty(q)) {
        struct vine_task *t = vine_wait(m,5);
        if(t) {
            printf("Task %d has returned!\n", t->taskid);
            if(t->return_status == 0) {
                printf("command exit code: %d\n", t->exit_code);
                printf("stdout: %s\n", t->output);
            } else {
                printf("There was a problem executing the task.\n");
            }
        }
    }
    ```

A completed task will have its output files written to disk. You may examine
the standard output of the task in `output` and the exit code in
`exit_status`.

!!! note
    The size of `output` is limited to 1 GB. Any output beyond 1 GB will be
    truncated. So, please redirect the stdout `./my-command > my-stdout` of the
    task to a file and specify the file as an output file of the task as
    described above.

When you are done with the task, delete it (only needed for C):

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_task_delete(t);
    ```

Continue submitting and waiting for tasks until all work is complete. You may
check to make sure that the queue is empty with `vine_empty`. When all
is done, delete the queue (only needed for C):

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_delete(q);
    ```

Full details of all of the taskvine functions can be found in the [taskvine API](api/html/taskvine_8h.html).

### Managing Python Tasks

A `PythonTask` is an extension of a standard task.
It is not defined with a command line to execute,
but with a Python function and its arguments, like this:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    def my_sum(x, y):
        return x+y

    # task to execute x = my_sum(1, 2)
    t = vine.PythonTask(my_sum, 1, 2)
    ```

A PythonTask is handled in the same way as a standard task,
except that its output `t.output` is simply the Python return
value of the function.  If the function should throw an exception,
then the output will be the exception object.

You can examine the result of a PythonTask like this:

=== "Python"
    ```
    while not m.empty():
        t = m.wait(5)
        if t:
            x = t.output
            if isinstance(x,Exception):
                print("Exception: {}".format(x))
            else:
                print("Result: {}".format(x))
    ```

A `PythonTask` is derived from `Task` and so all other methods for
controlling scheduling, managing resources, and setting performance options
all apply to `PythonTask` as well.

When running a Python function remotely, it is assumed that the Python interpreter
and libraries available at the worker correspond to the appropiate python environment for the task.
If this is not the case, an environment file can be provided with t.set_environment:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    t = vine.PythonTask(my_sum, 1, 2)
    t.set_environment("my-env.tar.gz")
    ```

The file `my-env.tar.gz` is a
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)
environment created with [conda-pack](https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/).  A
minimal environment can be created a follows:

```sh
conda create -y -p my-env python=3.8 dill conda
conda install -y -p my-env -c conda-forge conda-pack
# conda install -y -p my-env pip and conda install other modules, etc.
conda run -p my-env conda-pack
```

## Running Managers and Workers

This section makes use of a simple but complete exmample of a
TaskVine application to demonstrate various features.

Donload the example file for the language of your choice:

  * Python: [vine_python_function.py](examples/vine_python_function.py)
  * C: [vine_example_mosaic.c](examples/vine_example_mosaic.c.c)

### Language Specific Setup

Before running the application, you may need some
additional setup, depending on the language in use:

#### Python Setup

If you installed via Conda, then no further setup is needed.

If you are running a Python application and did *not* install via Conda,
then you will need to set the `PYTHONPATH` to point to the cctools
installation, like this:

```sh
# Note: This is only needed if not using Conda:
$ PYVER=$(python -c 'import sys; print("%s.%s" % sys.version_info[:2])')
$ export PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/cctools/lib/python${PYVER}/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}
```

#### C Language Setup

If you are writing a taskvine application in C, you should compile it into an executable like this:

```sh
$ gcc taskvine_example.c -o taskvine_example -I${HOME}/cctools/include/cctools -L${HOME}/cctools/lib -ltaskvine -ldttools -lm -lz
```

### Running a Manager Program

The example application simply compresses a bunch of files in parallel. The
files to be compressed must be listed on the command line. Each will be
transmitted to a remote worker, compressed, and then sent back to the
manager. To compress files `a`, `b`, and `c` with this example
application, run it as:


```sh
# Python:
$ ./taskvine_example.py a b c

# C
$ ./taskvine_example a b c
```

You will see this right away:


```sh
listening on port 9123...
submitted task: /usr/bin/gzip < a > a.gz
submitted task: /usr/bin/gzip < b > b.gz
submitted task: /usr/bin/gzip < c > c.gz
waiting for tasks to complete...
```

The taskvine manager is now waiting for workers to connect and begin
requesting work. (Without any workers, it will wait forever.) You can start
one worker on the same machine by opening a new shell and running:


```sh
# Substitute the IP or name of your machine for MACHINENAME.
$ vine_worker MACHINENAME 9123
```

If you have access to other machines, you can simply `ssh` there and run workers as well. In general, the more you start, the faster the work gets done. If a
worker should fail, the taskvine infrastructure will retry the work
elsewhere, so it is safe to submit many workers to an unreliable system.

### Submitting Workers to a Batch System

If you have access to a HTCondor pool, you can use this shortcut to submit ten
workers at once via HTCondor:

```sh
$ condor_submit_workers MACHINENAME 9123 10

Submitting job(s)..........
Logging submit event(s)..........
10 job(s) submitted to cluster 298.
```

This will cause HTCondor to schedule worker jobs on remote machines.
When they begin to run, they will call home to the indicated machine
and port number, and begin to service the manager application.

Similar scripts are available for other common batch systems:

```sh
$ slurm_submit_workers MACHINENAME 9123 10
$ sge_submit_workers MACHINENAME 9123 10
$ pbs_submit_workers MACHINENAME 9123 10
$ torque_submit_workers MACHINENAME 9123 10
```

When the manager completes, if the workers were not otherwise shut down,
they will still be available, so you can either run another manager
with the same workers, or you can remove the workers with `kill`, `condor_rm`,
or `qdel` as appropriate. If you forget to remove them, they will exit
automatically after fifteen minutes. (This can be adjusted with the `-t`
option to `worker`.)

### Project Names and the Catalog Server

Keeping track of the manager's hostname and port can get cumbersome, especially
if there are multiple managers. To help with this, a **project name** can be used to identify a taskvine manager with a human-readable name.
taskvine workers can then be started for their managers by providing
the project name instead of a host an port number.

The project name feature uses the [Catalog Server](../catalog) to maintain and track the
project names of managers and their respective locations. It works as follows:
the manager advertises its project name along with its hostname and port to the
catalog server. taskvine workers that are provided with the manager's project
name query the catalog server to find the hostname and port of the manager with
the given project name.

For example, to have a taskvine manager advertise its project name as
`myproject`, add the following code snippet after creating the queue:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    m = vine.Manager(name = "myproject")
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_set_name(m, "myproject");
    ```

To start a worker for this manager, specify the project name (`myproject`) to
connect in the `-M` option:

```sh
$ vine_worker -M myproject
```


You can start ten workers for this manager on Condor using
`condor_submit_workers` by providing the same option arguments.:

```sh
$ condor_submit_workers -M myproject 10
Submitting job(s)..........
Logging submit event(s)..........
10 job(s) submitted to cluster 298.
```

Or similarly on SGE using `sge_submit_workers` as:

```sh
$ sge_submit_workers -M myproject 10
Your job 153097 ("worker.sh") has been submitted
Your job 153098 ("worker.sh") has been submitted
Your job 153099 ("worker.sh") has been submitted
...
```

### taskvine Status Display

An additional benefit of using a project name is that you can
now use the [taskvine_status](../man_pages/taskvine_status) command
to display the progress of your application.  This shows the name,
location, and statistics of each application that reports itself to the
catalog server.  (Note that this information is updated about once
per minute.).  For example:

```sh
% vine_status
PROJECT               HOST                      PORT WAITING RUNNING COMPLETE WORKERS
molsim-c2h2           home.cse.nd.edu           8999     793      64      791      16
freds-model-search    mars.indiana.edu          9123     100     700     1372     350
yang-analysis-355     login.crc.nd.edu          9100    8932    4873    10007    4873
```

The same information is available in a more graphical form online
at the [taskvine Status Display](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/taskvine/status),
which looks like this:

<img src=examples/work-queue-status-example.png>

### Managing Workers with the taskvine Factory

Instead of launching each worker manually from the command line, the utility
**vine_factory** may be used to launch workers are needed. The factory
will submit and maintain a number of workers according to the tasks available
in one or more managers.
For example, we can supply a minimum of 2 workers and a maximum of 10 to
a manager with the project name `myproject` via the condor batch system as follows:

```sh
vine_factory -Tcondor --min-workers=2 --max-workers=10 --manager-name myproject
```

This arguments can be specified in a file. The factory will periodically
re-read this file, which allows adjustments to the number of workers desired:

Configuarion file `factory.json`:
```json
{
    "manager-name": "myproject",
    "max-workers": 10,
    "min-workers": 2
}
```
```sh
vine_factory -Tcondor -Cfactory.json
```

For further options, please refer to the taskvine factory [manual](../man_pages/vine_factory.md).

By default, the factory submits as many tasks that are waiting and running up
to a specified maximum. To run more than one task in a worker, please refer
to the following section on describing [task resources](#task-resources) and [worker resources](#taskvine-factory-and-resources).


#### Using the factory with python

We can create a factory directly in python. Creating a factory object does not
immediately launch it, so this is a good time to configure the resources,
number of workers, etc. Factory objects function as Python context managers, so
to indicate that a set of commands should be run with a factory running, wrap
them in a with statement. The factory will be cleaned up automtically at the
end of the block. As an example:

```python
workers = taskvine.Factory("condor", "myproject")
workers.cores = 4
workers.memory = 4000
workers.disk = 5000
workers.max_workers = 20
with workers:
    while not m.empty():
        t = m.wait(5)
        ...
```





## Managing Resources

Unless otherwise specified, taskvine assumes that a single task runs on a
single worker at a time, and a single worker occupies an entire machine.

However, if the resources at a machine are larger than what you know a task
requires, you most likely will want one worker to manage multiple tasks
running on that machine. For
example, if you have a 8-core machine, then you might want to run four 2-core
tasks on a single worker at once, being careful not to exceed the available
memory and disk.

### Task Resources

To run several tasks in a worker, every task must have a description of the
resources it uses, in terms of cores, memory, disk, and gpus. While time is
not exactly a type of resource, specifying the running time of tasks can
often be helpful to map tasks to workers. These resources can be specified
as in the following example:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    t.set_cores(1)                     # task needs one core
    t.set_memory(1024)                 # task needs 1024 MB of memory
    t.set_disk(4096)                   # task needs 4096 MB of disk space
    t.set_gpus(0)                      # task does not need a gpu
    t.set_time_max(100)        # task is allowed to run in 100 seconds
    t.set_time_min(10)         # task needs at least 10 seconds to run (see vine_worker --wall-time option above)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_task_set_cores(t,1)                 # task needs one core
    vine_task_set_memory(t,1024)             # task needs 1024 MB of memory
    vine_task_set_disk(t,4096)               # task needs 4096 MB of disk space
    vine_task_set_gpus(t,0)                  # task does not need a gpu
    vine_task_set_run_time_max(t,100)    # task is allowed to run in 100 seconds
    vine_task_set_run_time_min(t,10)     # task needs at least 10 seconds to run (see vine_worker --wall-time option above)
    ```

When the maximum running time is specified, taskvine will kill any task that
exceeds its maximum running time. The minimum running time, if specified, helps
taskvine decide which worker best fits which task.  Specifying tasks' running
time is especially helpful in clusters where workers may have a hard threshold
of their running time.

Resources are allocated according to the following rules:

1. If the task does not specify any resources, then it is allocated a whole worker.
2. The task will be allocated as least as much of the value of the resources
  specified. E.g., a task that specifies two cores will be allocated at
  least two cores.
3. If gpus remain unspecified, then the task is allocated zero gpus.
4. If a task specifies gpus, but does not specify cores, then the task is allocated zero cores.
5. In all other cases, cores, memory, and disk of the worker are divided
  evenly according to the maximum proportion of specified task
  requirements over worker resources. The proportions are rounded up so that
  only whole number of tasks could fit in the worker.

As an example, consider a task that only specifies 1 core, and does not specify
any other resource, and a worker with 4 cores, 12 GB of memory, and 36 GB of
disk. According to the rules above:

- Rule 1 does not apply, as at least one resource (cores) was specified.
- According to rule 2, the task will get at least one core.
- According to rule 3, the task will not be allocated any gpus.
- Rule 4 does not apply, as no gpus were specified, and cores were specified.
- For rule 5, the task requires 1 core, and the worker has 4 cores. This gives a proportion
  of 1/4=0.25. Thus, the task is assigned 25% of the memory and disk (3 GB and
  9 GB respectively).

As another example, now assume that the task specifies 1 cores and 6 GB of memory:

- Rules 1 to 4 are as the last example, only that now the task will get at
  least 6 GB of memory.
- From cores we get a proportion of 1/4=0.25, and from memory 6GB/12GB=0.5.
  The memory proportion dictates the allocation as it is the largest. This
  means that the task will get assigned 50% of the cores (2), memory
  (6 GB), and disk (18 GB).

Note that proportions are 'rounded up', as the following example shows.
Consider now that the task requires 1 cores, 6GB of memory, and 27 GB of disk:

- Rules 1 to 4 are as before, only that now the worker will get at
  least 30 GB of disk.
- The proportions are 1/4=0.25 for cores, 6GB/12GB=0.5 for memory, and
  27GB/36GB=0.75 for disk. This would assign 3 cores, 9 memory, and 27
  to the task. However, this would mean that no other task of this size would
  be able to run in the worker. Rather than assign 75% of the resources and
  risk an preventable failure because of resource exhaustion, the task is
  assigned 100% of the resources from the worker. More generally, allocations
  are rounded up so that only a whole number of tasks can be fit in the worker.

!!! note
    If you want TaskVine to exactly allocate the resources you have
    specified, use the `proportional-resources` and `proportional-whole-tasks`
    parameters as shown [here](#specialized-and-experimental-settings).  In
    general, however, we have found that using proportions nicely adapts to the
    underlying available resources, and leads to very few resource exhaustion
    failures while still using worker resources efficiently.

The current taskvine implementation only accepts whole integers for its
resources, which means that no worker can concurrently execute more tasks than
its number of cores. (This will likely change in the future.)

When you would like to run several tasks in a worker, but you are not sure
about the resources each task needs, taskvine can automatically find values
of resources that maximize throughput, or minimize waste. This is discussed in
the section [below](#grouping-tasks-with-similar-resources-needs).

### Worker Resources

By default, a worker tries to use all the resources of the machine it is
running.  The resources detected are displayed when the worker starts up,
for example:

```
vine_worker: creating workspace /tmp/worker-102744-8066
vine_worker: using 16 cores, 15843 MB memory, 61291 MB disk, 0 gpus
```

You can manually adjust the resources managed by a worker like this:


```sh
$ vine_worker --cores 8  --memory 1000 --disk 8000 --gpus 1 ...other options...
```

Unlike other resources, the default value for gpus is 0. You can use the
command line option `--gpus` to declare how many gpus are available at a
worker.

When the lifetime of the worker is known, for example, the end of life of a
lease, this information can be communicated to the worker as follows. For
example, if the worker will be terminated in one hour:

```sh
$ vine_worker --wall-time 3600 ...other options...
```

In combination with the worker option `--wall-time`, tasks can request a
minimum time to execute with `set_time_min`, as explained (below)[#setting-task-resources].

You may also use the same `--cores`, `--memory`, `--disk`, and `--gpus` options when using
batch submission scripts such as `condor_submit_workers` or
`slurm_submit_workers`, and the script will correctly ask the batch system for
a node of the desired size.

The only caveat is when using `sge_submit_workers`, as there are many
differences across systems that the script cannot manage. For `
sge_submit_workers ` you have to set **both** the resources used by the
worker (i.e., with `--cores`, etc.) and the appropiate computing node with the `
-p ` option.

For example, say that your local SGE installation requires you to set the
number of cores with the switch ` -pe smp ` , and you want workers with 4
cores:

```sh
$ sge_submit_workers --cores 4 -p "-pe smp 4" MACHINENAME 9123
```

If you find that there are options that are needed everytime, you can compile
CCTools using the ` --sge-parameter `. For example, at Notre Dame we
automatically set the number of cores as follows:

```sh
$ ./configure  --sge-parameter '-pe smp $cores'
```


So that we can simply call:

```sh
$ sge_submit_workers --cores 4 MACHINENAME 9123
```

The variables `$cores `, `$memory `, and `$disk `, have the values of the
options passed to `--cores`, `--memory`, `--disk. `

### Factory Resources

The `vine_factory` accepts the arguments `--cores`, `--memory`,
`--disk`, and `--gpus` to set the size of the desired workers. Resources may also be
set in the configuration file as follows:

```json
{
    "manager-name": "myproject",
    "max-workers": 4,
    "min-workers": 1,
    "cores": 4,
    "memory": 4096,
    "disk": 4096,
    "gpus": 1
}
```

Both memory and disk are set in `MB`.

### Monitoring and Enforcement

So far we have used resources values simply as hints to taskvine to schedule
concurrent tasks at workers. By default, taskvine does not monitor or enforce
these limits. You can enable monitoring and enforcement as follows:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    # Measure the resources used by tasks, and terminate tasks that go above their
    # resources:
    m.enable_monitoring()

    # Measure the resources used by tasks, but do not terminate tasks that go above
    # declared resources:
    m.enable_monitoring(watchdog=False)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    # Measure the resources used by tasks, and terminate tasks that go above their
    # resources:
    vine_enable_monitoring(m,0,0)

    # Measure the resources used by tasks, but do not terminate tasks that go above
    # declared resources:
    vine_enable_monitoring(m,0,1)
    ```

When monitoring is enabled, you can explore the resources measured when a task
returns:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    t = m.wait(5)
    if t:
        print("Task used {} cores, {} MB memory, {} MB disk",
            t.resources_measured.cores,
            t.resources_measured.memory,
            t.resources_measured.disk)
        print("Task was allocated {} cores, {} MB memory, {} MB disk",
            t.resources_requested.cores,
            t.resources_requested.memory,
            t.resources_requested.disk)
        if t.limits_exceeded and t.limits_exceeded.cores > -1:
            print("Task exceeded its cores allocation.")
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_task *t = vine_wait(m,5);
    if(t) {
        printf("Task used %f cores, %f MB memory, %f MB disk",
            t->resources_measured->cores,
            t->resources_measured->memory,
            t->resources_measured->disk);
        printf("Task was allocated %f cores, %f MB memory, %f MB disk",
            t->resources_requested->cores,
            t->resources_requested->memory,
            t->resources_requested->disk});
        if(t->limits_exceeded && t->limits_exceeded->cores > -1) {
            printf("Task exceeded its cores allocation.")
        }
    }
    ```

Alternatively, when you declare a task (i.e., before submitting it), you can
declare a directory to which a report of the resources will be written. The
report format is JSON, as its filename has the form
`vine-PID_OF_MANAGER-task-TASK_ID.summary`.

=== "Python"
    ```python
    t = vine.Task(...)
    t.set_monitor_output("my-resources-output")
    ...
    taskid = m.submit(t)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    struct vine_task *t = vine_task_create(...);
    vine_set_monitor_output("my-resources-output");
    ...
    int taskid = vine_submti(m, t);
    ```

taskvine also measures other resources, such as peak `bandwidth`,
`bytes_read`, `bytes_written`, `bytes_sent`, `bytes_received`,
`total_files`, `cpu_time`, and `wall_time`.


### Grouping Tasks with Similar Resource Needs

Several tasks usually share the same resource description, and to this end,
taskvine allows you to tasks into groups called **categories**. You can
attach resource descriptions to each category, and then label a task to set it
as part of a category.

We can create some categories with their resource description as follows:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    # memory and disk values in MB.
    m.set_category_resources_max('my-category-a', {'cores': 2, 'memory': 1024, 'disk': 2048, 'gpus': 0})
    m.set_category_resources_max('my-category-b', {'cores': 1})
    m.set_category_resources_max('my-category-c', {})
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    # memory and disk values in MB.
    struct rmsummary *ra = rmsummary_create(-1);
    ra->cores = 2;
    ra->memory = 1024;
    ra->disk = 2048;
    vine_set_resources_max("my-category-a", ra);
    rmsummary_delete(ra);

    struct rmsummary *rb = rmsummary_create(-1);
    rb->cores = 1;
    vine_set_resources_max("my-category-b", rb);
    rmsummary_delete(rb);

    vine_set_resources_max("my-category-c", NULL);
    ```

In the previous examples, we created three categories. Note that it is not
necessary to set all the resources, as taskvine can be directed to
compute some efficient defaults. To assign a task to a category:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    t.set_category('my-category-a')
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_task_set_category(t,"my-category-a")
    ```
When a category leaves some resource unspecified, then taskvine tries to find
some reasonable defaults in the same way described before in the section
(Specifying Task Resources)[#setting-task-resources].

!!! warning
    When a task is declared as part of a category, and also has resources
    set directly with calls such as `t.set_cores`, the resources
    directly set take precedence over the category declaration for that
    task

When the resources used by a task are unknown, taskvine can measure and
compute efficient resource values to maximize throughput or minimize waste, as
we explain in the following sections.

### Automatic Resource Management

If the resources a category uses are unknown, then taskvine can be directed
to find efficient resource values to maximize throughput or minimize resources
wasted. In these modes, if a value for a resource is set with
`set_resources_max`, then it is used as a theoretical maximum.

When automatically computing resources, if any of cores, memory or disk are
left unspecified in `set_resources_max`, then taskvine will run some
tasks using whole workers to collect some resource usage statistics. If all
cores, memory, and disk are set, then taskvine uses these maximum
values instead of using whole workers. As before, unspecified gpus default to 0.

Once some statistics are available, further tasks may run with smaller
allocations if such a change would increase throughput. Should a task exhaust
its resources, it will be retried using the values of `set_resources_max`,
or a whole worker, as explained before.

Automatic resource management is enabled per category as follows:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    m.enable_monitoring()
    m.set_category_resources_max('my-category-a', {})
    m.set_category_mode('my-category-a', m.VINE_ALLOCATION_MODE_MAX_THROUGHPUT)

    m.set_category_resources_max('my-category-b', {'cores': 2})
    m.set_category_mode('my-category-b', m.VINE_ALLOCATION_MODE_MAX_THROUGHPUT)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_enable_monitoring(m,0,0);
    vine_set_category_resources_max(m, "my-category-a", NULL);
    vine_set_category_mode(m, "my-category-a", VINE_ALLOCATION_MODE_MAX_THROUGHPUT);

    struct rmsummary *r = rmsummary_create(-1);
    r->cores = 2;
    vine_set_category_resources_max(m, "my-category-b", r);
    vine_set_category_mode(m, "my-category-b", VINE_ALLOCATION_MODE_MAX_THROUGHPUT);
    rmsummary_delete(r);
    ```

In the previous examples, tasks in 'my-category-b' will never use more than two
cores, while tasks in 'my-category-a' are free to use as many cores as the
largest worker available if needed.

You can set a limit on the minimum resource value a category can use. The
automatic resource computation will never go below the values set:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    m.set_category_resources_min('my-category-a', {'memory': 512})
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    struct rmsummary *r = rmsummary_create(-1);
    r->memory = 512;
    vine_set_category_resources_min(m,"my-category-a", r);
    rmsummary_delete(r);
    ```

You can enquire about the resources computed per category with
`vine_status`:


```
$ vine_status -A  IP-OF-MACHINE-HOSTING-WQ PORT-OF-WQ
CATEGORY        RUNNING    WAITING  FIT-WORKERS  MAX-CORES MAX-MEMORY   MAX-DISK
analysis            216        784           54          4      ~1011      ~3502
merge                20         92           30         ~1      ~4021      21318
default               1         25           54         >1       ~503       >243
```

In the above, we have three categories, with RUNNING and WAITING tasks. The
column FIT-WORKERS shows the count of workers that can fit at least one task in
that category using the maximum resources either set or found. Values for max
cores, memory and disk have modifiers `~` and `>` as follows:

- No modifier: The maximum resource usage set with `set_category_resources_max`, or set for any task in the category via calls such as `set_cores`.
- ~: The maximum resource usage so far seen when resource is left unspecified in `set_category_resources_max`. All tasks so far have run with no more than this resource value allocated.
- >: The maximum resource usage that has caused a resource exhaustion. If this value is larger than then one set with `set_category_resources_max`, then tasks that exhaust resources are not retried. Otherwise, if a maximum was not set, the tasks will be retried in larger workers as workers become available.


!!! warning
    When resources are set directly to the task with calls such as
    `t.set_cores`, such resources are fixed for the task and are not
    modified when more efficient values are found.

## Advanced Techniques

A variety of advanced features are available for programs with unusual needs
or very large scales. Each feature is described briefly here, and more details
may be found in the [taskvine
API](api/html/taskvine_8h.html).

### Security

By default, taskvine does **not** perform any encryption or authentication,
so any workers will be able to connect to your manager, and vice versa. This
may be fine for a short running anonymous application, but is not safe for a
long running application with a public name.

Currently, taskvine uses SSL to provide communication encryption, and a
password file to provide worker-manager authentication. These features can be
enabled independet of each other.


#### SSL support

taskvine can encrypt the communication between manager and workers using SSL.
For this, you need to set the key and certificate (in PEM format) of your
server when creating the queue.

If you do not have a key and certificate at hand, but you want the
communications to be encrypted, you can create your own key and certificate:

```sh
# Be aware that since this certificate would not be signed by any authority, it
# cannot be used to prove the identity of the server running the manager.

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout MY_KEY.pem -out MY_CERT.pem -sha256 -days 365 -nodes
```

To activate SSL encryption, indicate the paths to the key and certificate when
creating the queue:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    # Import the taskvine library
    import taskvine as vine
    m = vine.Manager(port=9123, ssl=('MY_KEY.pem', 'MY_CERT.pem'))

    # Alternatively, you can set ssl=True and let the python API generate
    # temporary ssl credentials for the queue:
    m = vine.Manager(port=9123, ssl=True)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```
    /* Import the taskvine library */
    #include "taskvine.h"

    /* Create a new queue listening on port 9123 */
    struct taskvine *m = vine_ssl_create(9123, 'MY_KEY.pem', 'MY_CERT.pem');
    ```


If you are using a (project name)[#project-names-and-the-catalog-server] for
your queue, then the workers will be aware that the manager is using SSL and
communicate accordingly automatically. However, you are directly specifying the
address of the manager when launching the workers, then you need to add the
`--ssl` flag to the command line, as:

```sh
vine_worker (... other args ...) --ssl HOST PORT
vine_factory (... other args ...) --ssl HOST PORT
vine_status --ssl HOST PORT
condor_submit_workers -E'--ssl' HOST PORT
```


#### Password Files

We recommend that you enable a password for your applications. Create a file
(e.g. ` mypwfile`) that contains any password (or other long phrase) that you
like (e.g. `This is my password`). The password will be particular to your
application and should not match any other passwords that you own. Note that
the contents of the file are taken verbatim as the password; this means that
any new line character at the end of the phrase will be considered as part of
the password.

Then, modify your manager program to use the password:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    m.set_password_file("mypwfile")
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_set_password_file(m,"mypwfile");
    ```


And give the `--password` option to give the same password file to your
workers:

```sh
$ vine_worker --password mypwfile -M myproject
```

With this option enabled, both the manager and the workers will verify that the
other has the matching password before proceeding. The password is not sent in
the clear, but is securely verified through a SHA1-based challenge-response
protocol.

### Maximum Retries

When a task cannot be completed because a worker disconnection or because it
exhausted some intermediate resource allocation, it is automatically retried.
By default, there is no limit on the number of retries. However, you can set a
limit on the number of retries:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    t.set_retries(5)   # Task will be try at most 6 times (5 retries).
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_set_retries(t, 5)
    ```

When a task cannot be completed in the set number of tries,
then the task result is set to  `VINE_RESULT_MAX_RETRIES`.

### Pipelined Submission

If you have a **very** large number of tasks to run, it may not be possible to
submit all of the tasks, and then wait for all of them. Instead, submit a
small number of tasks, then alternate waiting and submitting to keep a constant
number in the queue. The `hungry` will tell you if more submission are
warranted:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    if m.hungry():
        # submit more tasks...
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    if(vine_hungry(q)) {
        // submit more tasks...
    }
    ```

### Fetching Input Data via URL

Tasks can fetch remote data named by a URL into the worker's cache.
For example, if you have a large dataset provided by a web server,
use `add_url` to attach the URL to a local file.  The data
will be downloaded once per worker and then shared among all
tasks that require it:


=== "Python"
    ```python
    t.add_url("http://somewhere.com/data.tar.gz", "data.tar.gz", type=VINE_INPUT, cache=True)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```c
    vine_task_add_url(t,"http://somewhere.com/data.tar.gz", "data.tar.gz", VINE_INPUT, VINE_CACHE)
    ```

(Note that `add_url` does not currently support output data.)

### Fetching Input Data via Command

Input data for tasks can also be produced at the worker by arbitrary
shell commands.  The output of these commands can be cached and shared
among multiple tasks. This is particularly useful for unpacking or
post-processing downloaded data.  For example, to download `data.tar.gz` from
a URL and then unpack into the directory `data`:


=== "Python"
    ```python
    t.add_file_command("curl http://somewhere.com/data.tar.gz | tar cvzf -", "data" , type=VINE_INPUT, cache=True)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```c
    vine_task_add_file_command(t,"curl http://somewhere.com/data.txt | tar cvzf -", "data", VINE_INPUT, VINE_CACHE)
    ```

(Note that `add_file_command` does not currently support output data.)

### Watching Output Files

If you would like to see the output of a task as it is produced, add
`VINE_WATCH` to the flags argument of `add_file`. This will
cause the worker to periodically send output appended to that file back to the
manager. This is useful for a program that produces a log or progress bar as
part of its output.

=== "Python"
    ```python
    t.add_output_file("my-file", flags = vine.VINE_WATCH)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_task_add_file(t, "my-file", "my-file", VINE_OUTPUT, VINE_WATCH);
    ```

### Optional Output Files

It is sometimes useful to return an output file only in the case of a failed task.
For example, if your task generates a very large debugging output file `debug.out`,
then you might not want to keep the file if the task succeeded.  In this case,
you can add the `VINE_FAILURE_ONLY` flag to indicate that a file should
only be returned in the event of failure:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    t.add_output_file("debug.out", flags = vine.VINE_FAILURE_ONLY)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_task_add_file(t, "debug.out", "debug.out", VINE_OUTPUT, VINE_FAILURE_ONLY);
    ```

In a similar way, the `VINE_SUCCESS_ONLY` flag indicates that an output file
should only be returned if the task actually succeeded.

### Disconnect slow workers

A large computation can often be slowed down by stragglers. If you have a
large number of small tasks that take a short amount of time, then
automatically disconnecting slow workers can help. With this feature enabled,
statistics are kept on tasks execution times and statistical outlier are
terminated. If two different tasks are canceled in the same worker, then the
worker is disconnected and blacklisted.

=== "Python"
    ```python
    # Disconnect workers that are executing tasks twice as slow as compared to the average.
    m.enable_disconnect_slow_workers(2)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    // Disconnect workers that are executing tasks twice as slow as compared to the average.
    vine_enable_disconnect_slow_workers(m, 2);
    ```

Tasks terminated this way are automatically retried in some other worker.
Each retry allows the task to run for longer and longer times until a
completion is reached. You can set an upper bound in the number of retries with
[Maximum Retries](#maximum-retries).

### String Interpolation

If you have workers distributed across multiple operating systems (such as
Linux, Cygwin, Solaris) and/or architectures (such as i686, x86_64) and have
files specific to each of these systems, this feature will help. The strings
$OS and $ARCH are available for use in the specification of input file names.
taskvine will automatically resolve these strings to the operating system
and architecture of each connected worker and transfer the input file
corresponding to the resolved file name. For example:

=== "Python"
    ```C
    t.add_input_file("my-executable.$OS.$ARCH", "my-exe")
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_task_add_file(t,"my-executable.$OS.$ARCH","./my-exe",VINE_INPUT,VINE_CACHE);
    ```

This will transfer `my-executable.Linux.x86_64` to workers running on a Linux
system with an x86_64 architecture and `a.Cygwin.i686` to workers on Cygwin
with an i686 architecture.

Note this feature is specifically designed for specifying and distingushing
input file names for different platforms and architectures. Also, this is
different from the $VINE_SANDBOX shell environment variable that exports
the location of the working directory of the worker to its execution
environment.


### Task Cancellations

This feature is useful in workflows where there are redundant tasks or tasks
that become obsolete as other tasks finish. Tasks that have been submitted can
be cancelled and immediately retrieved without waiting for taskvine to
return them in `vine_wait`. The tasks to cancel can be identified by
either their `taskid` or `tag`. For example:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    # create task as usual and tag it with an arbitrary string.
    t = vine.Task(...)
    t.set_tag("my-tag")

    taskid = m.submit(t)

    # cancel task by id. Return the canceled task.
    t = m.cancel_by_taskid(taskid)

    # or cancel task by tag. Return the canceled task.
    t = m.cancel_by_tasktag("my-tag")
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    // create task as usual and tag it with an arbitrary string.
    struct vine_task *t = vine_task_create("...");
    vine_set_task(t, "my-tag");

    int taskid = vine_submit(m, t);

    // cancel task by id. Return the canceled task.
    t = vine_cancel_by_taskid(m, taskid);

    # or cancel task by tag. Return the canceled task.
    t = vine_cancel_by_tasktag(m, "my-tag");
    ```


!!! note
    If several tasks have the same tag, only one of them is cancelled. If you
    want to cancel all the tasks with the same tag, you can use loop until
    `cancel_by_task` does not return a task, as in:
```
    while m.cancel_by_taskid("my-tag"):
        pass
```


### Worker Blacklist

You may find that certain hosts are not correctly configured to run your
tasks. The manager can be directed to ignore certain workers with the blacklist
feature. For example:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    t = m.wait(5)

    # if t fails given a worker misconfiguration:
    m.blacklist(t.hostname)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    struct vine_task *t = vine_wait(m, t);

    //if t fails given a worker misconfiguration:
    vine_blacklist_add(m, t->{hostname});
    ```

### Performance Statistics

The queue tracks a fair number of statistics that count the number of tasks,
number of workers, number of failures, and so forth. This information is useful
to make a progress bar or other user-visible information:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    stats = m.stats
    print(stats.workers_busy)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    struct vine_stats stats;
    vine_get_stats(m, &stats);
    printf("%d\n", stats->workers_connected);
    ```

### Python Abstractions

#### Map

The taskvine map abstraction works similar to python map, as it applies a
a function to every element in a list. This function works by taking in a chunk_size,
which is the size of an iterable to send to a worker. The worker than maps the given
function over the iterable and returns it. All the results are then combined from the
workers and returned. The size of the chunk depends on the cost of the function.
If the function is very cheap, then sending a larger chunk_size is better. If the
function is expensive, then smaller is better. If an invalid operation happens,
the error will appear in the results.

```python
def fn(a):
    return a*a

m.map(fn, arry, chunk_size)
```

#### Pair

The taskvine pair function computes all the pairs of 2 sequences, and then uses
them as inputs of a given function. The pairs are generated locally using itertools,
and then based on the given chunk_size, are sent out to a worker as an iterable of pairs.
The given function must accept an iterable, as the pair will be sent to the function as
a tuple. The worker will then return the results, and each result from each worker will be
combined locally. Again, cheaper functions work better with larger chunk_sizes,
more expensive functions work better with smaller ones. Errors will be placed in results.

```python
def fn(pair):
    return pair[0] * pair[1]

m.pair(fn, seq1, seq2, chunk_size)
```

#### Tree Reduce

The taskvine treeReduce fucntion combines an array using a given function by
breaking up the array into chunk_sized chunks, computing the results, and returning
the results to a new array. It then does the same process on the new array until there
only one element left and then returns it. The given fucntion must accept an iterable,
and must be an associative fucntion, or else the same result cannot be gaurenteed for
different chunk sizes. Again, cheaper functions work better with larger chunk_sizes,
more expensive functions work better with smaller ones. Errors will be placed in results.
Also, the minimum chunk size is 2, as going 1 element at time would not reduce the array

```python
def fn(seq):
    return max(seq)

m.treeReduce(fn, arry, chunk_size)
```

Below is an example of all three abstractions, and their expected output:

```
--8<-- "taskvine/examples/vine_hof.py"
```

Run:
```
python abstractions.py
```

Expected output:
```
Map: [2, 4, 6, 8]
Pair: [2, 4, 6, 8, 4, 8, 12, 16, 6, 12, 18, 24, 8, 18, 24, 32]
Tree: 8
```

## Logging facilities

We can observe the lifetime of the queue through three different logs:


### Debug Log

The debug log prints unstructured messages as the queue transfers files and
tasks, workers connect and report resources, etc. This is specially useful to
find failures, bugs, and other errors. To activate debug output:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    m = vine.Manager(debug_log = "my.debug.log")
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    #include "debug.h"
    cctools_debug_flags_set("all");
    cctools_debug_config_file("my.debug.log");
    ```

The `all` flag causes debug messages from every subsystem called by taskvine
to be printed. More information about the debug flags are
[here](api/html/debug_8h.html).


To enable debugging at the worker, set the `-d` option:


```sh
$ vine_worker -d all -o worker.debug -M myproject
```

### Statistics Log

The statistics logs contains a time series of the statistics collected by the manager,
such as number of tasks waiting and completed, number of workers busy,
total number of cores available, etc. The log is activated as follows:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    m = vine.Manager(stats_log = "my.statslog")
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_enable_perf_log(m, "my.stats.log");
    ```

The time series are presented in columns, with the leftmost column as a
timestamp in microseconds. The first row always contains the name of the
columns. Here is an example of the first few rows and columns.

```text
# timestamp workers_connected workers_init workers_idle workers_busy workers_...
1602165237833411 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 1602165237827668 ...
1602165335687547 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 1602165237827668 ...
1602165335689677 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 1 1 5 1 0 0 0 0 1602165237827668 ...
...
```

The script `vine_graph_log` is a wrapper for `gnuplot`, and with it you
can plot some of the statistics, such as total time spent transfering tasks,
number of tasks running, and workers connected:

```sh
$ vine_graph_log -o myplots my.stats.log
$ ls *.png
$ ... my.stats.log.tasks.png my.stats.log.tasks-log.png my.stats.log.time.png my.stats.log.time-log.png ...
```

We find it very helpful to plot these statistics when diagnosing a problem with
taskvine applications.

### Transactions Log

Finally, the transactions log records the lifetime of tasks and workers. It is
specially useful for tracking the resources requested, allocated, and used by
tasks. It is activated as follows:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    m = vine.Manager(transactions_log = "my.tr.log")
    ```

=== "C"
    ```C
    vine_enable_transactions_log(m, "my.tr.log");
    ```

The first few lines of the log document the possible log records:

```text
# time manager_pid MANAGER START|END
# time manager_pid WORKER worker_id host:port CONNECTION
# time manager_pid WORKER worker_id host:port DISCONNECTION (UNKNOWN|IDLE_OUT|FAST_ABORT|FAILURE|STATUS_WORKER|EXPLICIT
# time manager_pid WORKER worker_id RESOURCES {resources}
# time manager_pid CATEGORY name MAX {resources_max_per_task}
# time manager_pid CATEGORY name MIN {resources_min_per_task_per_worker}
# time manager_pid CATEGORY name FIRST (FIXED|MAX|MIN_WASTE|MAX_THROUGHPUT) {resources_requested}
# time manager_pid TASK taskid WAITING category_name (FIRST_RESOURCES|MAX_RESOURCES) {resources_requested}
# time manager_pid TASK taskid RUNNING worker_address (FIRST_RESOURCES|MAX_RESOURCES) {resources_allocated}
# time manager_pid TASK taskid WAITING_RETRIEVAL worker_address
# time manager_pid TASK taskid (RETRIEVED|DONE) (SUCCESS|SIGNAL|END_TIME|FORSAKEN|MAX_RETRIES|MAX_WALLTIME|UNKNOWN|RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION) exit_code {limits_exceeded} {resources_measured}
# time manager_pid TRANSFER (INPUT|OUTPUT) taskid cache_flag sizeinmb walltime filename
```

Lowercase words indicate values, and uppercase indicate constants. A bar (|) inside parentheses indicate a choice of possible constants. Variables encased in braces {} indicate a JSON dictionary. Here is an example of the first few records of a transactions log:

```
1599244364466426 16444 MASTER START
1599244364466668 16444 TASK 1 WAITING default FIRST_RESOURCES {"cores":[1,"cores"],"memory":[800,"MB"],"disk":[500,"MB"]}
1599244364466754 16444 TASK 2 WAITING default FIRST_RESOURCES {"cores":[1,"cores"],"memory":[800,"MB"],"disk":[500,"MB"]}
...
```

With the transactions log, it is easy to track the lifetime of a task. For example, to print the lifetime of the task with id 1, we can simply do:

```
$ grep 'TASK \<1\>' my.tr.log
1599244364466668 16444 TASK 1 WAITING default FIRST_RESOURCES {"cores":[1,"cores"],"memory":[800,"MB"],"disk":[500,"MB"]}
1599244400311044 16444 TASK 1 RUNNING 10.32.79.143:48268  FIRST_RESOURCES {"cores":[4,"cores"],"memory":[4100,"MB"],...}
1599244539953798 16444 TASK 1 WAITING_RETRIEVAL 10.32.79.143:48268
1599244540075173 16444 TASK 1 RETRIEVED SUCCESS  0  {} {"cores":[1,"cores"],"wall_time":[123.137485,"s"],...}
1599244540083820 16444 TASK 1 DONE SUCCESS  0  {} {"cores":[1,"cores"],"wall_time":[123.137485,"s"],...}
```

The script `vine_graph_workers` is an interactive visualization tool for
taskvine transaction logs based on Python `bokeh` package. It can be used to
visualize the life time of tasks and workers, as well as diagnosing the effects
of file transfer time on overall performance. See
[vine_graph_workers(1)](../man_pages/vine_graph_workers.md) for
detailed information.

## Specialized and Experimental Settings

The behaviour of taskvine can be tuned by the following parameters. We advise
caution when using these parameters, as the standard behaviour may drastically
change.

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| category-steady-n-tasks | Minimum number of successful tasks to use a sample for automatic resource allocation modes<br>after encountering a new resource maximum. | 25 |
| proportional-resources | If set to 0, do not assign resources proportionally to tasks. The default is to use proportions. (See [task resources.](#task-resources) | 1 |
| proportional-whole-tasks | Round up resource proportions such that only an integer number of tasks could be fit in the worker. The default is to use proportions. (See [task resources.](#task-resources) | 1 |
| hungry-minimum          | Smallest number of waiting tasks in the queue before declaring it hungry | 10 |
| resource-submit-multiplier | Assume that workers have `resource x resources-submit-multiplier` available.<br> This overcommits resources at the worker, causing tasks to be sent to workers that cannot be immediately executed.<br>The extra tasks wait at the worker until resources become available. | 1 |
| wait-for-workers        | Do not schedule any tasks until `wait-for-workers` are connected. | 0 |
| wait-retrieve-many      | Rather than immediately returning when a task is done, `m.wait(timeout)` retrieves and dispatches as many tasks<br> as `timeout` allows. Warning: This may exceed the capacity of the manager to receive results. | 0 |

=== "Python"
    ```python
    m.tune("hungry-minumum", 20)
    ```

=== "C"
    ```
    vine_tune(m, "hungry-minumum", 20)
    ```
