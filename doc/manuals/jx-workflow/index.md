# The JX Workflow Language

The JX Workflow Language is a language for expressing workflows
that allows for easy manipulations to the structure and
partitioning of a workflow.  It makes use of the [JX (JSON Extended)](../jx)
expression language to create concise and expressive structures.
Using JX, it is easy to treat a subset of the workflow as if it were an atomic job that can be dispatched as part of a higher-level application.
