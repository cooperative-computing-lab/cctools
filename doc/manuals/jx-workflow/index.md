# The JX Workflow Language

JX (JSON eXtended) is a language for expressing workflows that allows for easy
manipulations to the structure and partitioning of a workflow.

JX extends a JSON representation of the workflow by supporting a Python-like
syntax for expressions, allowing for a concise intermediate representation that
expands to a normal JSON document. Using JX, it is easy to treat a subset of
the workflow as if it were an atomic job that can be dispatched as part of a
higher-level application.
