# Work Queue User's Manual

## Overview

Work Queue is a framework for building large scale manager-worker applications.
Using the Work Queue library, you create a custom manager program that defines
and submits a large number of small tasks. Each task is distributed to a
remote worker process which executes it and returns the results. As results
are created, the manager may generate more tasks to be executed. It is not
unusual to write programs that distribute millions of tasks to thousands of
remote workers.

Each worker process is a common executable that can be deployed within
existing cluster and cloud systems, so it's easy to deploy a Work Queue
application to run on machines that you already have access to. Whether you
use a university batch system or a commercial cloud provider, your Work Queue
application will be able to run there.

Work Queue is a production framework that has been used to create highly
scalable scientific applications in high energy physics, bioinformatics, data
mining, and other fields. It can also be used as an execution system for the
[Makeflow](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/makeflow) workflow engine. To see
some of the Work Queue applications running right now, view the [real time
status page](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/workqueue/status).

## Getting Started

### Installing

See the [Installation Instructions](../install) for the Cooperative Computing Tools package.  We recommend that first time users
install via Conda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge ndcctools
```

The full documentation for the Work Queue API can be found here:
- [Work Queue Python API](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/manuals/api/html/namespaceWorkQueuePython.html).
- [Work Queue Perl API](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/manuals/api/html/namespaceWorkQueuePerl.html)
- [Work Queue C API](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/manuals/api/html/work__queue_8h.html) and

## Building a Work Queue Application

We begin by running a simple but complete example of a Work Queue application.
After trying it out, we will then show how to write a Work Queue application
from scratch.

First, download the example file for the language of your choice:

  * Python: [work_queue_example.py](examples/work_queue_example.py)
  * Perl: [work_queue_example.pl](examples/work_queue_example.pl)
  * C: [work_queue_example.c](examples/work_queue_example.c)

If you are using the Python example and did *not* install via Conda, then set `PYTHONPATH` to include the Python modules in cctools:
    
```sh
# Note: This is only needed if not using Conda:
$ PYVER=$(python -c 'import sys; print("%s.%s" % sys.version_info[:2])')
$ export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${HOME}/cctools/lib/python${PYVER}/site-packages
```

If you are using the Perl example, set `PERL5LIB` to include the Perl modules in
cctools:

```sh
$ export PERL5LIB=${PERL5LIB}:${HOME}/cctools/lib/perl5/site_perl
```

If you are using the C example, compile it like this:

```sh
$ gcc work_queue_example.c -o work_queue_example -I${HOME}/cctools/include/cctools -L${HOME}/cctools/lib -lwork_queue -ldttools -lm -lz
```
   
    

## Running a Work Queue Application

The example application simply compresses a bunch of files in parallel. The
files to be compressed must be listed on the command line. Each will be
transmitted to a remote worker, compressed, and then sent back to the Work
Queue manager. To compress files `a`, `b`, and `c` with this example
application, run it as:


```sh
# Python:
$ ./work_queue_example.py a b c
 
# Perl:
$ ./work_queue_example.pl a b c
 
# C
$ ./work_queue_example a b c
```

You will see this right away:


```sh
listening on port 9123...
submitted task: /usr/bin/gzip < a > a.gz
submitted task: /usr/bin/gzip < b > b.gz
submitted task: /usr/bin/gzip < c > c.gz
waiting for tasks to complete...
```
    

The Work Queue manager is now waiting for workers to connect and begin
requesting work. (Without any workers, it will wait forever.) You can start
one worker on the same machine by opening a new shell and running:

    
```sh
# Substitute the IP or name of your machine for MACHINENAME.
$ work_queue_worker MACHINENAME 9123
```

If you have access to other machines, you can `ssh` there and run workers as
well. In general, the more you start, the faster the work gets done. If a
worker should fail, the work queue infrastructure will retry the work
elsewhere, so it is safe to submit many workers to an unreliable system.

If you have access to a Condor pool, you can use this shortcut to submit ten
workers at once via Condor:

```sh
$ condor_submit_workers MACHINENAME 9123 10

Submitting job(s)..........
Logging submit event(s)..........
10 job(s) submitted to cluster 298.
```
    

Or, if you have access to an SGE cluster, do this:

```sh
$ sge_submit_workers MACHINENAME 9123 10

Your job 153083 ("worker.sh") has been submitted
Your job 153084 ("worker.sh") has been submitted
Your job 153085 ("worker.sh") has been submitted
...
```
    

Similar scripts are available for other common batch systems:

```sh
$ pbs_submit_workers MACHINENAME 9123 10

$ torque_submit_workers MACHINENAME 9123 10

$ slurm_submit_workers MACHINENAME 9123 10

$ ec2_submit_workers MACHINENAME 9123 10
```

When the manager completes, if the workers were not shut down in the manager,
your workers will still be available, so you can either run another manager
with the same workers, or you can remove the workers with `kill`, `condor_rm`,
or `qdel` as appropriate. If you forget to remove them, they will exit
automatically after fifteen minutes. (This can be adjusted with the `-t`
option to `worker`.)

## Writing a Work Queue Manager Program

The easiest way to start writing your own program using WorkQueue is to modify
with one of the examples in [Python](examples/work_queue_example.py),
[Perl](examples/work_queue_example.pl), or [C](examples/work_queue_example.c).
The basic outline of a WorkQueue manager is:

1. Create and configure the tasks' queue.
2. Create tasks and add them to the queue.
3. Wait for tasks to complete.

To create a new queue listening on port 9123:

#### Python

```python
import work_queue as wq

# create a new queue listening on port 9123
q = wq.WorkQueue(9123)
```

#### Perl

```perl
use Work_Queue;

# create a new queue listening on port 9123
my $q = Work_Queue->new(9123);
```

#### C

```C
#include "work_queue.h"
    
# create a new queue listening on port 9123
struct work_queue *q = work_queue_create(9123);
```
    
The manager then creates tasks to submit to the queue. Each task consists of a
command line to run and a statement of what data is needed, and what data will
be produced by the command. Input data can be provided in the form of a file
or a local memory buffer. Output data can be provided in the form of a file or
the standard output of the program. It is also required to specify whether the
data, input or output, need to be cached at the worker site for later use.

In the example, we specify a command `./gzip` that takes a single input file
`my-file` and produces a single output file `my-file.gz`. We then create a task
by providing the specified command as an argument:

#### Python

```python
t = wq.Task("./gzip < my-file > my-file.gz")
```

#### Perl

```perl
my $t = Work_Queue::Task->new("./gzip < my-file > my-file.gz");
```

#### C

```C
struct work_queue_task *t = work_queue_task_create("./gzip < my-file > my-file.gz");
```
    
The input and output files associated with the execution of the task must be
explicitly specified. In the example, we also specify the executable in the
command invocation as an input file so that it is transferred and installed in
the working directory of the worker. We require this executable to be cached
so that it can be used by subsequent tasks that need it in their execution. On
the other hand, the input and output of the task are not required to be cached
since they are not used by subsequent tasks in this example.


#### Python
    
```python
# t.specify_input_file("name at manager", "name when copied at execution site", ...)

t.specify_input_file("/usr/bin/gzip", "gzip",       cache = True)
t.specify_input_file("my-file",       "my-file",    cache = False)
t.specify_output_file("my-file.gz",   "my-file.gz", cache = False)

# when the name at manager is the same as the exection site, we can write instead:
t.specify_input_file("my-file",     cache = False)
t.specify_output_file("my-file.gz", cache = False)
```

#### Perl
    
```perl
# $t->specify_input_file(local_name => "name at manager", remote_name => "name when copied at execution site", ...);

$t->specify_input_file(local_name => "/usr/bin/gzip", remote_name => "gzip",       cache = True);
$t->specify_input_file(local_name => "my-file",       remote_name => "my-file",    cache = False);
$t->specify_output_file(local_name => "my-file.gz",   remote_name => "my-file.gz", cache = False);

# when the name at manager is the same as the exection site, we can write instead:
$t->specify_input_file(local_name => "my-file",     cache = False);
$t->specify_output_file(local_name => "my-file.gz", cache = False);
```


#### C

```C
# work_queue_task_specify_file(t, "name at manager", "name when copied at execution site", ...)

work_queue_task_specify_file(t, "/usr/bin/gzip", "gzip",       WORK_QUEUE_INPUT,  WORK_QUEUE_CACHE);
work_queue_task_specify_file(t, "my-file",       "my-file",    WORK_QUEUE_INPUT,  WORK_QUEUE_NOCACHE);
work_queue_task_specify_file(t, "my-file.gz",    "my-file.gz", WORK_QUEUE_OUTPUT, WORK_QUEUE_NOCACHE);
```

Note that the specified input directories and files for each task are
transferred and setup in the sandbox directory of the worker (unless an
absolute path is specified for their location). This sandbox serves as the
initial working directory of each task executed by the worker. The task
outputs are also stored in the sandbox directory (unless an absolute path is
specified for their storage). The path of the sandbox directory is exported to
the execution environment of each worker through the `WORK_QUEUE_SANDBOX` shell
environment variable. This shell variable can be used in the execution
environment of the worker to describe and access the locations of files in the
sandbox directory.

We can also run a program that is already installed at the remote site, where
the worker runs, by specifying its installed location in the command line of
the task (and removing the specification of the executable as an input file).
For example:

#### Python

```python
t = Task("/usr/bin/gzip < my-file > my-file.gz")
```

#### Perl

```perl
my $t = Work_Queue::Task->new("/usr/bin/gzip < my-file > my-file.gz")
```

#### C

```C
struct work_queue_task *t = work_queue_task_create("/usr/bin/gzip < my-file > my-file.gz");
```

Once a task has been fully specified, it can be submitted to the queue where it
gets assigned a unique taskid:

### Python

```python
taskid = q.submit(t)
```

### Perl

```perl
my $taskid = $q->submit($t)
```

#### C

```C
int taskid = work_queue_submit(q,t);
```

Next, wait for a task to complete, stating how long you are willing to wait for
a result, in seconds:

#### Python
    
```python
while not q.empty():
    t = q.wait(5)
    if t:
        print("Task {} has returned!".format(t.id))

        if t.return_status == 0:
            print("command exit code:\n{}".format(t.exit_code))
            print("stdout:\n{}".format(t.output))
        else:
            print("There was a problem executing the task.")
```

#### Perl
    
```perl
while(not $q->empty()) {
    my $t = $q->wait(5)
    if($t) {
        print("Task @{[$t->id]} has returned!\n");

        if($t->{return_status} == 0) {
            print("command exit code:\n@{[$t->{exit_code}]}\n");
            print("stdout:\n@{[$t->{output}]}\n");
        } else {
            print("There was a problem executing the task.\n");
        }
    }
}
```

#### C

```C
while(!work_queue_empty(q)) {
    struct work_queue_task *t = work_queue_wait(q,5);
    if(t) {
        printf("Task %d has returned!\n", t->taskid);
        if(t->return_status == 0) {
            printf("command exit code: %d\n", t->exit_code);
            printf("stdout: %s\n", t->output);
        } else {
            printf("There was a problem executing the task.\n");
        }

    }
}
```

A completed task will have its output files written to disk. You may examine
the standard output of the task in `output` and the exit code in
`exit_status`.

!!! note
    The size of `output` is limited to 1 GB. Any output beyond 1 GB will be
    truncated. So, please redirect the stdout `./my-command > my-stdout` of the
    task to a file and specify the file as an output file of the task as
    described above.

When you are done with the task, delete it (only needed for C):

#### C
```C
work_queue_task_delete(t);
```

Continue submitting and waiting for tasks until all work is complete. You may
check to make sure that the queue is empty with `work_queue_empty`. When all
is done, delete the queue (only needed for C):

#### C

```C
work_queue_delete(q);
```

Full details of all of the Work Queue functions can be found in the [Work Queue API](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/manuals/api/html/work__queue_8h.html).


## Project Names and the Catalog Server

Keeping track of the manager's hostname and port can get cumbersome, especially
if there are multiple managers. To help with difficulty, we provide the project
name feature to identify a Work Queue manager with a more recognizable project
name. Work Queue workers can then be started for their managers by providing
the project names.

The project name feature uses the **catalog server** to maintain and track the
project names of managers and their respective locations. It works as follows:
the manager advertises its project name along with its hostname and port to the
catalog server. Work Queue workers that are provided with the manager's project
name query the catalog server to find the hostname and port of the manager with
the given project name. So, to utilize this feature, the manager must be
specified to run in the `WORK_QUEUE_MANAGER_MODE_CATALOG`. See [Catalog
Servers](../catalog) for details on specifying catalog servers.

For example, to have a Work Queue manager advertise its project name as
`myproject`, add the following code snippet after creating the queue:

#### Python
```python
q = wq.WorkQueue(name = "myproject")
```

#### Perl
```perl
my $q = Work_Queue->new(name => "myproject");
```

#### C

```C
work_queue_specify_name(q, "myproject");
```
    

    
To start a worker for this manager, specify the project name (`myproject`) to
connect in the `-M` option:

```sh
$ work_queue_worker -M myproject
```
    

You can start ten workers for this manager on Condor using
`condor_submit_workers` by providing the same option arguments.:
    
```sh
$ condor_submit_workers -M myproject 10
Submitting job(s)..........
Logging submit event(s)..........
10 job(s) submitted to cluster 298.
```

Or similarly on SGE using `sge_submit_workers` as:

```sh
$ sge_submit_workers -M myproject 10
Your job 153097 ("worker.sh") has been submitted
Your job 153098 ("worker.sh") has been submitted
Your job 153099 ("worker.sh") has been submitted
...
```

Project names are particularly useful when automatically maintaining a pool of workers with the **work queue factory**, as explained next.

### Work Queue Factory

Instead of launching each worker manually from the command line, the utility
**work_queue_factory** may be used to launch workers are needed. The factory
will submit and maintain a number of workers according to the tasks available
in one or more managers.
For example, we can supply a minimum of 2 workers and a maximum of 10 to
a manager with the project name `myproject` via the condor batch system as follows:

```sh
work_queue_factory -Tcondor --min-workers=2 --max-workers=10 --manager-name myproject
```

This arguments can be specified in a file. The factory will periodically
re-read this file, which allows adjustments to the number of workers desired:

Configuarion file `factory.json`:
```json
{
    "manager-name": "myproject",
    "max-workers": 10,
    "min-workers": 2
}
```
```sh
work_queue_factory -Tcondor -Cfactory.json
```

For further options, please refer to the work queue factory [manual](../man_pages/work_queue_factory.md).

By default, the factory submits as many tasks that are waiting and running up
to a specified maximum. To run more than one task in a worker, please refer
to the following section on describing [task resources](#task-resources) and [worker resources](#work-queue-factory-and-resources).

## Managing Resources

Unless otherwise specified, Work Queue assumes that a single task runs on a
single worker at a time, and a single worker occupies an entire machine.

However, if the resources at a machine are larger than what you know a task
requires, you most likely you will want one worker to manage multiple tasks
running on that machine. For
example, if you have a 8-core machine, then you might want to run four 2-core
tasks on a single worker at once, being careful not to exceed the available
memory and disk.

### Worker Resources

By default, a worker tries to use all the resources of the machine it is
running.  The resources detected are displayed when the worker starts up,
for example:

```
work_queue_worker: creating workspace /tmp/worker-102744-8066
work_queue_worker: using 16 cores, 15843 MB memory, 61291 MB disk, 0 gpus
```

You can manually adjust the resources managed by a worker like this:

    
```sh
$ work_queue_worker --cores 8  --memory 1000 --disk 8000 --gpus 1
```

Unlike other resources, the default value for gpus is 0. You can use the
command line option `--gpus` to declare how many gpus are available at a
worker.
    
You may also use the same `--cores`, `--memory`, `--disk`, and `--gpus` options when using
batch submission scripts such as `condor_submit_workers` or
`slurm_submit_workers`, and the script will correctly ask the batch system for
a node of the desired size.

The only caveat is when using `sge_submit_workers`, as there are many
differences across systems that the script cannot manage. For `
sge_submit_workers ` you have to specify **both** the resources used by the
worker (i.e., with `--cores`, etc.) and the appropiate computing node with the `
-p ` option.

For example, say that your local SGE installation requires you to specify the
number of cores with the switch ` -pe smp ` , and you want workers with 4
cores:

```sh
$ sge_submit_workers --cores 4 -p "-pe smp 4" MACHINENAME 9123
```

If you find that there are options that are needed everytime, you can compile
CCTools using the ` --sge-parameter `. For example, at Notre Dame we
automatically set the number of cores as follows:

```sh
$ ./configure  --sge-parameter '-pe smp $cores'
```
    

So that we can simply call:

```sh
$ sge_submit_workers --cores 4 MACHINENAME 9123
```
    
The variables `$cores `, `$memory `, and `$disk `, have the values of the
options passed to `--cores`, `--memory`, `--disk. `

### Factory Resources

The `work_queue_factory` accepts the arguments `--cores`, `--memory`,
`--disk`, and `--gpus` to specify the size of the desired workers. Resources may also be
specified in the configuration file as follows:

```json
{
    "manager-name": "myproject",
    "max-workers": 4,
    "min-workers": 1,
    "cores": 4,
    "memory": 4096,
    "disk": 4096,
    "gpus": 1
}
```

Both memory and disk are specified in `MB`.
 

### Specifying Task Resources

To run several tasks in a worker, every task must have a description of the
resources it uses, in terms of cores, memory, disk, and gpus. While time is 
not exactly a type of resource, specifying the running time of tasks can 
often be helpful to map tasks to workers. These resources can be specified 
as in the following example:

```python
t.specify_cores(1)                     # task needs one core
t.specify_memory(1024)                 # task needs 1024 MB of memory
t.specify_disk(4096)                   # task needs 4096 MB of disk space
t.specify_gpus(0)                      # task does not need a gpu
t.specify_running_time_max(100)        # task is allowed to run in 100 seconds
t.specify_running_time_min(10)         # task needs at least 10 seconds to run
```

```perl
$t->specify_cores(1)      # task needs one core
$t->specify_memory(1024)  # task needs 1024 MB of memory
$t->specify_disk(4096)    # task needs 4096 MB of disk space
$t->specify_gpus(0)       # task does not need a gpu
$t->specify_running_time_max(100)  # task is allowed to run in 100 seconds
$t->specify_running_time_min(10)   # task needs at least 10 seconds to run
```

When all cores, memory, and disk are specified, Work Queue will simply fit as
many tasks as possible without going above the resources available at a
particular worker. When the maximum running time is specified, Work Queue will
kill any task that exceeds its maximum running time. The minimum running time, 
if specified, helps Work Queue decide which worker best fits which task. 
Specifying tasks' running time is especially helpful in clusters where workers 
may have a hard threshold of their running time.

When some of the resources are left unspecified, then Work Queue tries to find
some reasonable defaults as follows:

- If no resources are specified, or all resources are specified to be 0, then a
  single task from the category will consume a **whole worker**.
- Unspecified gpus are always zero.
- If a task specifies gpus, then the default cores is zero.
- Unspecified cores, memory and disk will get a default according to the
  proportion the specified resources will use at a worker, rounding-up. Thus,
  if task specifies that it will use two cores, but does not specify memory or
  disk, it will be allocated %50 of memory and disk in 4-core workers, or %25
  in 8-core workers. When more than one resource is specified, the default uses
  the largest proportion.

The current Work Queue implementation only accepts whole integers for its
resources, which means that no worker can concurrently execute more tasks than
its number of cores. (This will likely change in the future.)

When you would like to run several tasks in a worker, but you are not sure
about the resources each task needs, Work Queue can automatically find values
of resources that maximize throughput, or minimize waste. This is discussed in
the section (below)[#grouping-tasks-with-similar-resources-needs].


### Monitoring and Enforcement

So far we have used resources values simply as hints to Work Queue to schedule
concurrent tasks at workers. By default, Work Queue does not monitor or enforce
these limits. You can enable monitoring and enforcement as follows:


```python
# Measure the resources used by tasks, and terminate tasks that go above their
# resources:
q.enable_monitoring()

# Measure the resources used by tasks, but do not terminate tasks that go above
# declared resources:
q.enable_monitoring(watchdog=False)
```

```perl
# Measure the resources used by tasks, and terminate tasks that go above their
# resources:
$q->enable_monitoring()

# Measure the resources used by tasks, but do not terminate tasks that go above
# declared resources:
$q->enable_monitoring(watchdog => 0)
```

When monitoring is enabled, you can explore the resources measured when a task
returns:

```python
t = q.wait()
if t:
    print("Task used {} cores, {} MB memory, {} MB disk",
        t.resources_measured.cores,
        t.resources_measured.memory,
        t.resources_measured.disk)
    print("Task was allocated {} cores, {} MB memory, {} MB disk",
        t.resources_requested.cores,
        t.resources_requested.memory,
        t.resources_requested.disk)
    if t.limits_exceeded and t.limits_exceeded.cores > -1:
        print("Task exceeded its cores allocation.")
```

```perl
my $t = $q=>wait()
if($t) {
    say("Task used %f cores, %f MB memory, %f MB disk",
        $t->resources_measured->{cores},
        $t->resources_measured->{memory},
        $t->resources_measured->{disk})
    say("Task was allocated %f cores, %f MB memory, %f MB disk",
        t.resources_requested->{cores},
        t.resources_requested->{memory},
        t.resources_requested->{disk})
    if($t->limits_exceeded and $t->limits_exceeded{cores} > -1) {
        say("Task exceeded its cores allocation.")
    }
}
```

Alternatively, when you declare a task (i.e., before submitting it), you can
declare a directory to which a report of the resources will be written. The
report format is JSON, as its filename has the form
`wq-PID_OF_MANAGER-task-TASK_ID.summary`.

```python
t = wq.Task(...)
t.specify_monitor_output("my-resources-output")
...
q.submit(t)
```

```perl
$t = WorkQueue::Task->new(...)
$t->specify_monitor_output("my-resources-output")
...
$q->submit($t)
```

Work Queue also measures other resources, such as peak `bandwidth`,
`bytes_read`, `bytes_written`, `bytes_sent`, `bytes_received`,
`total_files`, `cpu_time`, and `wall_time`.


### Grouping Tasks with Similar Resources Needs

Several tasks usually share the same resource description, and to this end,
Work Queue allows you to tasks into groups called **categories**. You can
attach resource descriptions to each category, and then label a task to set it
as part of a category.

We can create some categories with their resource description as follows:

#### Python

```python
# memory and disk values in MB.
q.specify_category_max_resources('my-category-a', {'cores': 2, 'memory': 1024, 'disk': 2048, 'gpus': 0})
q.specify_category_max_resources('my-category-b', {'cores': 1})
q.specify_category_max_resources('my-category-c', {})
```

```perl
# memory and disk values in MB.
$q->specify_category_max_resources('my-category-a', {'cores' => 2, 'memory' => 1024, 'disk' => 2048, 'gpus' => 0})
$q->specify_category_max_resources('my-category-b', {'cores' => 1})
$q->specify_category_max_resources('my-category-c', {})
```

In the previous examples, we created three categories. Note that it is not
necessary to specify all the resources, as Work Queue can be directed to
compute some efficient defaults. To assign a task to a category:

```python
t.specify_category('my-category-a')
```

```perl
$t->specify_category('my-category-a')
```

When a category leaves some resource unspecified, then Work Queue tries to find
some reasonable defaults in the same way described before in the section
(Specifying Task Resources)[#specifying-task-resources].

!!! warning
    When a task is declared as part of a category, and also has resources
    specified directly with calls such as `t.specify_cores`, the resources
    directly specified take precedence over the category declaration for that
    task

When the resources used by a task are unknown, Work Queue can measure and
compute efficient resource values to maximize throughput or minimize waste, as
we explain in the following sections. 

#### Automatic Management of Task Resources in a Category

If the resources a category uses are unknown, then Work Queue can be directed
to find efficient resource values to maximize throughput or minimize resources
wasted. In these modes, if a value for a resource is specified with
`specify_max_resources`, then it is used as a theoretical maximum.

When automatically computing resources, if any of cores, memory or disk are
left unspecified in `specify_max_resources`, then Work Queue will run some
tasks using whole workers to collect some resource usage statistics. If all
cores, memory, and disk are specified, then Work Queue uses these maximum
values instead of using whole workers. As before, unspecified gpus default to 0.

Once some statistics are available, further tasks may run with smaller
allocations if such a change would increase throughput. Should a task exhaust
its resources, it will be retried using the values of `specify_max_resources`,
or a whole worker, as explained before.

Automatic resource management is enabled per category as follows:

```python
q.enable_monitoring()
q.specify_category_max_resources('my-category-a', {})
q.specify_category_mode('my-category-a', q.WORK_QUEUE_ALLOCATION_MODE_MAX_THROUGHPUT)

q.specify_category_max_resources('my-category-b', {'cores': 2})
q.specify_category_mode('my-category-b', q.WORK_QUEUE_ALLOCATION_MODE_MAX_THROUGHPUT)
```

```perl
$q->enable_monitoring()
$q->specify_category_max_resources('my-category-a', {})
$q->specify_category_mode('my-category', q.WORK_QUEUE_ALLOCATION_MODE_MAX_THROUGHPUT)

$q->specify_category_max_resources('my-category-b', {'cores' => 2})
$q->specify_category_mode('my-category', q.WORK_QUEUE_ALLOCATION_MODE_MAX_THROUGHPUT)
```

In the previous examples, tasks in 'my-category-b' will never use more than two
cores, while tasks in 'my-category-a' are free to use as many cores as the
largest worker available if needed.

You can set a limit on the minimum resource value a category can use. The
automatic resource computation will never go below the values specified:

```python
q.specify_category_min_resources('my-category-a', {'memory': 512})
```

```perl
$q->specify_category_min_resources('my-category-a', {'memory' => 512})
```

You can enquire about the resources computed per category with
`work_queue_status`:


```
$ work_queue_status -A  IP-OF-MACHINE-HOSTING-WQ PORT-OF-WQ
CATEGORY        RUNNING    WAITING  FIT-WORKERS  MAX-CORES MAX-MEMORY   MAX-DISK
analysis            216        784           54          4      ~1011      ~3502
merge                20         92           30         ~1      ~4021      21318
default               1         25           54         >1       ~503       >243
```

In the above, we have three categories, with RUNNING and WAITING tasks. The
column FIT-WORKERS shows the count of workers that can fit at least one task in
that category using the maximum resources either set or found. Values for max
cores, memory and disk have modifiers `~` and `>` as follows:

- No modifier: The maximum resource usage set with `specify_category_max_resources`, or set for any task in the category via calls such as `specify_cores`.
- ~: The maximum resource usage so far seen when resource is left unspecified in `specify_category_max_resources`. All tasks so far have run with no more than this resource value allocated.
- >: The maximum resource usage that has caused a resource exhaustion. If this value is larger than then one specified with `specify_category_max_resources`, then tasks that exhaust resources are not retried. Otherwise, if a maximum was not set, the tasks will be retried in larger workers as workers become available.


!!! warning
    When resources are specified directly to the task with calls such as
    `t.specify_cores`, such resources are fixed for the task and are not
    modified when more efficient values are found.

## Recommended Practices

### Security

By default, Work Queue does **not** perform any authentication, so any workers
will be able to connect to your manager, and vice versa. This may be fine for a
short running anonymous application, but is not safe for a long running
application with a public name.

We recommend that you enable a password for your applications. Create a file
(e.g. ` mypwfile`) that contains any password (or other long phrase) that you
like (e.g. `This is my password`). The password will be particular to your
application and should not match any other passwords that you own. Note that
the contents of the file are taken verbatim as the password; this means that
any new line character at the end of the phrase will be considered as part of
the password.

Then, modify your manager program to use the password:

#### Python

```python
q.specify_password_file("mypwfile")
```

#### Perl

```perl
$q->specify_password_file("mypwfile");
```

#### C

```C
work_queue_specify_password_file(q,"mypwfile");
```
    

And give the `--password` option to give the same password file to your
workers:
    
```sh
$ work_queue_worker --password mypwfile -M myproject
```

With this option enabled, both the manager and the workers will verify that the
other has the matching password before proceeding. The password is not sent in
the clear, but is securely verified through a SHA1-based challenge-response
protocol.

## Logging facilities

We can observe the lifetime of the queue through three different logs:


### Debug Log

The debug log prints unstructured messages as the queue transfers files and
tasks, workers connect and report resources, etc. This is specially useful to
find failures, bugs, and other errors. To activate debug output:

#### Python

```python
q = wq.WorkQueue(debug_log = "my.debug.log")
```

#### Perl

```perl
my $q = Work_Queue->new(debug_log => "my.debug.log");
```

#### C

```C
#include "debug.h"

cctools_debug_flags_set("all");
cctools_debug_config_file("my.debug.log");
```
    
The `all` flag causes debug messages from every subsystem called by Work Queue
to be printed. More information about the debug flags are
[here](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/manuals/api/html/debug_8h.html).


To enable debugging at the worker, set the `-d` option:

    
```sh
$ work_queue_worker -d all -o worker.debug -M myproject
```

### Statistics Log

The statistics logs contains a time series of the statistics collected by Work
Queue, such as number of tasks waiting and completed, number of workers busy,
total number of cores available, etc. The log is activated as follows:

#### Python

```python
q = wq.WorkQueue(stats_log = "my.statslog")
```

#### Perl

```perl
my $q = Work_Queue->new(stats_log => "my.stats.log");
```

#### C

```C
work_queue_specify_log(q, "my.stats.log");
```

The time series are presented in columns, with the leftmost column as a
timestamp in microseconds. The first row always contains the name of the
columns. Here is an example of the first few rows and columns.

```text
# timestamp workers_connected workers_init workers_idle workers_busy workers_...
1602165237833411 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 1602165237827668 ...
1602165335687547 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 1602165237827668 ...
1602165335689677 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 1 1 5 1 0 0 0 0 1602165237827668 ...
...
```

The script `work_queue_graph_log` is a wrapper for `gnuplot`, and with it you
can plot some of the statistics, such as total time spent transfering tasks,
number of tasks running, and workers connected:

```sh
$ work_queue_graph_log -o myplots my.stats.log
$ ls *.png
$ ... my.stats.log.tasks.png my.stats.log.tasks-log.png my.stats.log.time.png my.stats.log.time-log.png ...
```

We find it very helpful to plot these statistics when diagnosing a problem with
work queue applications.

### Transactions Log

Finally, the transactions log records the lifetime of tasks and workers. It is
specially useful for tracking the resources requested, allocated, and used by
tasks. It is activated as follows:

#### Python

```python
q = wq.WorkQueue(transactions_log = "my.tr.log")
```

#### Perl

```perl
my $q = Work_Queue->new(transactions_log => "my.tr.log");
```

#### C

```C
work_queue_specify_transactions_log(q, "my.tr.log");

The first few lines of the log document the possible log records:

```text
# time master_pid MASTER START|END
# time master_pid WORKER worker_id host:port CONNECTION
# time master_pid WORKER worker_id host:port DISCONNECTION (UNKNOWN|IDLE_OUT|FAST_ABORT|FAILURE|STATUS_WORKER|EXPLICIT)
# time master_pid WORKER worker_id RESOURCES {resources}
# time master_pid CATEGORY name MAX {resources_max_per_task}
# time master_pid CATEGORY name MIN {resources_min_per_task_per_worker}
# time master_pid CATEGORY name FIRST (FIXED|MAX|MIN_WASTE|MAX_THROUGHPUT) {resources_requested}
# time master_pid TASK taskid WAITING category_name (FIRST_RESOURCES|MAX_RESOURCES) {resources_requested}
# time master_pid TASK taskid RUNNING worker_address (FIRST_RESOURCES|MAX_RESOURCES) {resources_allocated}
# time master_pid TASK taskid WAITING_RETRIEVAL worker_address
# time master_pid TASK taskid (RETRIEVED|DONE) (SUCCESS|SIGNAL|END_TIME|FORSAKEN|MAX_RETRIES|MAX_WALLTIME|UNKNOWN|RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION) exit_code {limits_exceeded} {resources_measured}
```

Lowercase words indicate values, and uppercase indicate constants. A bar (|) inside parentheses indicate a choice of possible constants. Variables encased in braces {} indicate a JSON dictionary. Here is an example of the first few records of a transactions log:

```
1599244364466426 16444 MASTER START
1599244364466668 16444 TASK 1 WAITING default FIRST_RESOURCES {"cores":[1,"cores"],"memory":[800,"MB"],"disk":[500,"MB"]}
1599244364466754 16444 TASK 2 WAITING default FIRST_RESOURCES {"cores":[1,"cores"],"memory":[800,"MB"],"disk":[500,"MB"]}
...
```

With the transactions log, it is easy to track the lifetime of a task. For example, to print the lifetime of the task with id 1, we can simply do:

```
$ grep 'TASK \<1\>' my.tr.log
1599244364466668 16444 TASK 1 WAITING default FIRST_RESOURCES {"cores":[1,"cores"],"memory":[800,"MB"],"disk":[500,"MB"]}
1599244400311044 16444 TASK 1 RUNNING 10.32.79.143:48268  FIRST_RESOURCES {"cores":[4,"cores"],"memory":[4100,"MB"],...}
1599244539953798 16444 TASK 1 WAITING_RETRIEVAL 10.32.79.143:48268
1599244540075173 16444 TASK 1 RETRIEVED SUCCESS  0  {} {"cores":[1,"cores"],"wall_time":[123.137485,"s"],...}
1599244540083820 16444 TASK 1 DONE SUCCESS  0  {} {"cores":[1,"cores"],"wall_time":[123.137485,"s"],...}
```


## Advanced Topics

A variety of advanced features are available for programs with unusual needs
or very large scales. Each feature is described briefly here, and more details
may be found in the [Work Queue
API](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/manuals/api/html/work__queue_8h.html).

### Maximum retries

When a task cannot be completed because a worker disconnection or because it
exhausted some intermediate resource allocation, it is automatically retried.
By default, there is no limit on the number of retries. However, you can set a
limit on the number of retries:

```python
t.specify_max_retries(5)   # Task will be try at most 6 times (5 retries).
```

```perl
$t->specify_max_retries(5)   # Task will be try at most 6 times (5 retries).
```

```C
work_queue_specify_max_retries(t, 5)
```

When a task cannot be completed in the specified number of tries, it is
returned with the result `WORK_QUEUE_RESULT_MAX_RETRIES`. In python this would
look like:

```python
import work_queue as wq
t = q.wait(5)
if t:
    if t.result == wq.WORK_QUEUE_RESULT_MAX_RETRIES:
        print("Task could not be completed in the specified number of attempts.")
```


### Pipelined Submission.

If you have a **very** large number of tasks to run, it may not be possible to
submit all of the tasks, and then wait for all of them. Instead, submit a
small number of tasks, then alternate waiting and submitting to keep a constant
number in the queue. The `hungry` will tell you if more submission are
warranted:

#### Python

```python
if q.hungry():
    # submit more tasks...
```

#### Perl

```perl
if($q->hungry()) {
    # submit more tasks...
}
```

#### C

```C
if(q->hungry()) {
    // submit more tasks...
}
```


### Watching Output Files

If you would like to see the output of a task as it is produced, add
`WORK_QUEUE_WATCH` to the flags argument of `specify_file`. This will
cause the worker to periodically send output appended to that file back to the
manager. This is useful for a program that produces a log or progress bar as
part of its output.

#### Python
```python
t.specify_output_file("my-file", flags = wq.WORK_QUEUE_WATCH)
```

#### Perl
```perl
$t->specify_output_file(local_name => "my-file", flags = wq.WORK_QUEUE_WATCH)
```

#### C
```C
work_queue_task_specify_file(t, "my-file", "my-file", WORK_QUEUE_OUTPUT, WORK_QUEUE_NOCACHE | WORK_QUEUE_WATCH);
```

### Fast Abort

A large computation can often be slowed down by stragglers. If you have a
large number of small tasks that take a short amount of time, then Fast Abort
can help. The Fast Abort feature keeps statistics on tasks execution times and
proactively aborts tasks that are statistical outliers:

#### Python
```python
# Disconnect workers that are executing tasks twice as slow as compared to the
# average.
q.activate_fast_abort(2)
```

#### Perl
```perl
# Disconnect workers that are executing tasks twice as slow as compared to the
# average.
$q->activate_fast_abort(2);
```

#### C
```C
// Disconnect workers that are executing tasks twice as slow as compared to the
// average.
work_queue_activate_fast_abort(q, 2);
```

Tasks that trigger fast abort are automatically retried in some other worker.
Each retry allows the task to run for longer and longer times until a
completion is reached. You can set an upper bound in the number of retries with
[Maximum retries](#maximum-retries).


### String Interpolation

If you have workers distributed across multiple operating systems (such as
Linux, Cygwin, Solaris) and/or architectures (such as i686, x86_64) and have
files specific to each of these systems, this feature will help. The strings
$OS and $ARCH are available for use in the specification of input file names.
Work Queue will automatically resolve these strings to the operating system
and architecture of each connected worker and transfer the input file
corresponding to the resolved file name. For example:

#### Python
```C
t.specify_input_file("my-executable.$OS.$ARCH", "my-exe")
```

#### Perl
```perl
$t->specify_output_file(local_name => "my-executable.$OS.$ARCH", remote_name => "my-exe");
```

#### C

```C
work_queue_task_specify_file(t,"my-executable.$OS.$ARCH","./my-exe",WORK_QUEUE_INPUT,WORK_QUEUE_CACHE);
```

This will transfer `my-executable.Linux.x86_64` to workers running on a Linux
system with an x86_64 architecture and `a.Cygwin.i686` to workers on Cygwin
with an i686 architecture.

Note this feature is specifically designed for specifying and distingushing
input file names for different platforms and architectures. Also, this is
different from the $WORK_QUEUE_SANDBOX shell environment variable that exports
the location of the working directory of the worker to its execution
environment.


### Task Cancellations

This feature is useful in workflows where there are redundant tasks or tasks
that become obsolete as other tasks finish. Tasks that have been submitted can
be cancelled and immediately retrieved without waiting for Work Queue to
return them in `work_queue_wait`. The tasks to cancel can be identified by
either their `taskid` or `tag`. For example:

```python
# create task as usual and tag it with an arbitrary string.
t = wq.Task(...)
t.specify_tag("my-tag")

taskid = q.submit(t)

# cancel task by id. Return the canceled task.
t = q.cancel_by_taskid(taskid)

# or cancel task by tag. Return the canceled task.
t = q.cancel_by_tasktag("my-tag")
```


```perl
# create task as usual and tag it with an arbitrary string.
my $t = Work_Queue::Task->new(...)
my $t->specify_tag("my-tag")

my taskid = $q->submit($t);

# cancel task by id. Return the canceled task.
$t = $q->cancel_by_taskid(taskid);

# or cancel task by tag. Return the canceled task.
$t = $q->cancel_by_tasktag("my-tag");
```

```C
// create task as usual and tag it with an arbitrary string.
struct work_queue_task *t = work_queue_task_create("...");
work_queue_specify_task(t, "my-tag");

int taskid = work_queue_submit(q, t);

// cancel task by id. Return the canceled task.
t = work_queue_cancel_by_taskid(q, taskid);

# or cancel task by tag. Return the canceled task.
t = work_queue_cancel_by_tasktag(q, "my-tag");
```


!!! note
    If several tasks have the same tag, only one of them is cancelled. If you
    want to cancel all the tasks with the same tag, you can use loop until
    `cancel_by_task` does not return a task, as in:
```
    while q->cancel_by_taskid("my-tag"):
        pass
```


### Worker Blacklist

You may find that certain hosts are not correctly configured to run your
tasks. The manager can be directed to ignore certain workers with the blacklist
feature. For example:

#### Python
```python
t = q.wait(5)

# if t fails given a worker misconfiguration:
q.blacklist(t.hostname)
```

#### Perl
```perl
my $t = $q->wait(5);

# if $t fails given a worker misconfiguration:
$q->blacklist($t->hostname);
```

#### C
```C
struct work_queue_task *t = work_queue_wait(q, t);

//if t fails given a worker misconfiguration:
work_queue_blacklist_add(q, t->{hostname});
```

### Performance Statistics

The queue tracks a fair number of statistics that count the number of tasks,
number of workers, number of failures, and so forth. This information is useful
to make a progress bar or other user-visible information:

#### Python
```python
stats = q.stats
print(stats.workers_busy)
```

#### Perl
```perl
my $stats = $q->stats;
print($stats->{task_running});
```

#### C
```C
struct work_queue_stats stats;
work_queue_get_stats(q, &stats);
printf("%d\n", stats->workers_connected);
```
