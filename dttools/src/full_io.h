/** @file full_io.h
Perform complete I/O operations, retrying through failures and signals.
A subtle property of Unix is that the kernel may choose to leave an I/O
operation incomplete, returning a smaller number of bytes than you requested,
or simply giving up with the error EINTR, if it is simply more "convenient".
The full_io routines look lik normal Unix read and write operations, but
silently retry through temporary failures.  Of course, these routines may still
fail for more permanent reasons such as end of file or disk full.
