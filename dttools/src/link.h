/** @file link.h A high level TCP connection library.
A <b>link</b> is a TCP connection to a process on another machine.  This module works at a higher level of abstraction than the socket library, with an easier-to-use API and explicit support for timeouts.
<p>
Timeouts are specified using an absolute stoptime.  For example, if you want
a connection to be attempted for sixty seconds, specify <tt>time(0)+60</tt>.
The operation will be tried and retried until that absolute limit, giving
the caller much greater control over program behavior.
<p>
Note that this library manipulates IP addresses in the form of strings.
To convert a hostname into a string IP address, call @ref domain_name_cache_lookup.  For example, here is how to make a simple HTTP request:
<pre>
struct link *link;
time_t stoptime = time(0)+300;
char addr[LINK_ADDRESS_MAX];
int result;

const char *request = "GET / HTTP/1.0\n\n";

result = domain_name_cache_lookup("www.google.com",addr);
if(!result) fatal("could not lookup name");

link = link_connect(addr,80,stoptime);
if(!link) fatal("could not connect");

result = link_write(link,request,strlen(request),stoptime);
if(result<0) fatal("could not send request");

link_stream_to_file(link,stdout,1000000,stoptime);
link_close(link);
</pre>
