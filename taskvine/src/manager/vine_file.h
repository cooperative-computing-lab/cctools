/*
This module defines the internal structure and details of a single file.
Here, a "file" can come from many different sources: a local file,
a remote url, a command to run on the worker, etc, and is then eventually
mapped into a tasks' working directory.  As a result, it has several kinds of names:

- f->source indicates the name of the source file, url, or command that provides the data.
- f->cached_name indicates the name of the file as it is stored in the worker's cache.
- f->remote_name indicates the name of the file as the task expects to see it.

This module is private to the manager and should not be invoked by the end user.
