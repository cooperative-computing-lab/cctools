/*
This module defines the internal structure and details of a single file.
Here, a "file" can come from many different sources: a local file,
a remote url, a command to run on the worker, etc, and is then eventually
mapped into a tasks' working directory via a vine_mount.
As a result, it has several kinds of names:

- f->source indicates the name of the source file, url, or command that provides the data.
- f->cached_name indicates the name of the file as it is stored in the worker's cache.

This module is private to the manager and should not be invoked by the end user.
