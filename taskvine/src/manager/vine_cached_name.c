/*
For a given task and file, generate the name under which the file
should be stored in the remote cache directory.

The basic strategy is to construct a name that is unique to the
namespace from where the file is drawn, so that tasks sharing
the same input file can share the same copy.

In the common case of files, the cached name is based on the
hash of the local path, with the basename of the local path
included simply to assist with debugging.

In each of the other file types, a similar approach is taken,
including a hash and a name where one is known, or another
unique identifier where no name is available.
*/

/*
For a given file we want the generation of a cachename for said file to be injective.
This ensures the files cached at the worker are the exact files we need.

For each file type a different strategy must be used to generate the cachenames for that file.
Given that files can generally have the same name across namespaces solely using the filename is
not adequate when generating cachenames.

Preferably cachenames would always be generated using data relevant to the contents of the file.
However, this is not always available. The following discusses methods for generating cachenames
for each file type:

VINE_BUFFER - With buffers, the content of the buffer is available to us we can then use an adequate
hashing function on the contents of the buffer.

VINE_FILE - With local files, Assuming we have permission to read the given file, the contents of
the file are available for us to hash. However, due to the variable sizes of files and the number of files
that may need to be hashed, hashing can cause an unwanted amount of overhead. However, different hashing methods
can generate different changes to our overhead to be more favorable. Furthermore, it is important that any method chose
is consistent and avoids conflicts adequately. For directories, which are a subset of the VINE_FILE classification,
it is important that the directory is hashed from its contents. This can be done by using a variation of a merkle tree.
That is, each hash of a directory is a hash of the hashes of the files with the directory. This can be done recursively.

VINE_EMPTY_DIR - Are there cases where an empty directory needs to be unique?

VINE_URL - With files possibly hosted on remote machines, We generally dont have access to the contents unless one
transfers the entire file to the site of the manager which is somewhat antithetical to the use case for VINE_URLs. Here,
our general strategy is to only retrieve the header of the file from the server. With the information in the header,
some fields can give us insights to the identity of the file. More on HTTP header fields:
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4229#section-2.1.24 Once, the header is retrieved, fields such as Content-MD5, ETag,
and Last-Modified can be used to generate the cachenames. The following on are details on each header field used:

	'Content-MD5' - This is an md5 digest of the entity, This field could be generated by an origin server or a
client. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#page-121

	'ETag' - an ETag or entity-tag is an "opaque" cache validator. Typically used to validate changes for a given
resource. There is no specification on how an ETag can be generated on a server. It could be a hash of the content, but
this is not always the case. ETags that begin with W/ indicate that a weak validator was used to generate the ETag.
	https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#page-126
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag

	'Last-Modified' - This is the date and time the a resource was last changed on a server
	https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#page-89

We then generate a hierarchy of header-fields that is equivalent to the order as they appear above. The reasoning is as
follows: With md5 hashes We can determine that two files with the same hash are the same. For ETags, we can be confident
that two files are the same IF they are from the same server. This follows for Las-Modified timestamps but an extra
piece of information is needed to generate the cachename. For each header retrieved we opt for the field that is highest
on the hierarchy when present. For Last-Modified, we need an additional field to generate a cachename(as two files can
have identical last-modified dates). Currently, this is the url for the given file in addition to the server where the
file is to be retrieved. For each field, each bit of necessary information can be combined together to generate the
hash.


VINE_MINITASK - A minitask is the resulting file after executing a given command on the worker. At times these commands
have their own file dependencies which have their own cachenames. There is the  possibility of generating the cachename
for the minitask from the cachenames of the files that the mini task depends on. However, certain commands have a level
of dynanicism in which it we cannot use this method to adequately predict the identity of the resulting file. It could
be a possibility to just let the user decide whether a command can have a cachename. However, what happens if they are
wrong?

When a cachename cannot be generated - There is an argument that if cachename cannot be generated given the present
information, that the file should not be cached. That is, generating a cachename could lead to possible conflicts on the
worker side.
