/*
This example shows some of the data handling features of taskvine.
It performs a BLAST search of the "Landmark" model organism database.
It works by constructing tasks that download the blast executable
and landmark database from NCBI, and then performs a short query.

Each task in the workflow performs a query of the database using
16 (random) query strings generated at the manager.
Both the downloads are automatically unpacked, cached, and shared
with all the same tasks on the worker.
