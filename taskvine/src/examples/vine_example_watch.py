# This example program shows the behavior of the VINE_WATCH flag.

# If a task produces output to a file incrementally as it runs,
# it can be helpful to see that output piece by piece as it
# is produced. By simply adding the VINE_WATCH flag to the output
# of the program, taskvine will periodically check for output
# and return it to the manager while each task runs.  When the
# task completes, any remaining output is fetched.

# This example runs several instances of the task named
# vine_example_watch_trickle.sh, which gradually produces output
# every few seconds.  While running the manager program, open
# up another terminal, and observe that files output.0, output.1,
# etc are gradually produced throughout the run.
