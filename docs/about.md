The Cooperating Computing Tools (CCTools)  provides scientific users with the
ability to harness large scale cyberinfrastructure for data intensive
scientific applications.

The key components are the [Makeflow workflow system](makeflow), the [Work
Queue application framework](work_queue), and the [Parrot virtual
filesystem](parrot).

These components can be used separately or together to take existing POSIX
applications and scale them up from a single laptop all the way to national
scale infrastructure.
